space_88.txt$examples of direct nasaspace related research that helped humanity
space_88.txt$in general it will be interesting to see
space_88.txt$pat tang  mylar i think  i think they also pushed hi tech pat
space_88.txt$composites for airframes  look at fly by wire
space_88.txt$swept wingsif you fly in airliners youve reaped the benefits
space_88.txt$phil didnt one of the early jet fighters have these  i also think
space_88.txt$phil the germans did some work on these in wwii
space_88.txt$the naca came up with them before world war ii  nasa is directly
space_88.txt$descended from the naca with space added in
space_88.txt$youll notice that i didnt mention sweep wings even though the
space_88.txt$x5 tested at whats now dryden had them  we did steal that one
space_88.txt$dirctly from the germans  the difference is that swept wings dont
space_88.txt$change their angle of sweep sweep wings do  perhaps the similarity
space_88.txt$of names has caused some confusion  747s have swept wings f111s
space_88.txt$have sweep wings
space_88.txt$winglets  area ruling  digital fly by wire  ride smoothing
space_88.txt$phil a lot of this was also done by the military
space_88.txt$after nasa aerodynamicists proposed them and nasa test teams
space_88.txt$demonstrated them  richard whitcomb and rt jones at langley
space_88.txt$research center were giants in the field
space_88.txt$dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area
space_88.txt$ruling in the 70s and 50s respectively  its true that we
space_88.txt$used military aircraft as the testbeds kc135 and yf102 but
space_88.txt$that had more to do with availability and need than with military
space_88.txt$involvement  the yf102 was completely ours and the kc135 was
space_88.txt$bailed to us  the air force of course was interested in our
space_88.txt$results and supportive of our efforts
space_88.txt$dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s no
space_88.txt$mechnaical or analog backup to show you how confident we were
space_88.txt$general dynamics decided to make the f16 flybywire when they saw how
space_88.txt$successful we were  mind you the avro arrow and the x15 were both
space_88.txt$flybywire aircraft much earlier but analog
space_88.txt$phil egad im disagreeing with mary shafer
space_88.txt$the nasa habit of acquiring secondhand military aircraft and using
space_88.txt$them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing  on the other
space_88.txt$hand all those secondhand navy planes give our test pilots a chance
space_88.txt$to fold the wingssomething most pilots at edwards air force base
