sport_88.txt$jones files lawsuit against conte
sport_88.txt$marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performanceenhancing drugs
sport_88.txt$the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking 25m 13m in the suit conte whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation made the claims in a us television programme he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences in an email to the associated press on wednesday conte said i stand by everything i said jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000 her lawsuit filed in the us district court in san francisco said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she has never taken banned performanceenhancing drugs contes statements the suit added were false and malicious after the abc television program earlier this month jones lawyer richard nicholls said marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout she has never ever used performanceenhancing drugs victor conte is a man facing a 42count federal indictment while marion jones is one of americas most decorated female athletes mr contes statements have been wildly contradictory mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination
sport_88.txt$mr conte is simply not credible we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed the sports ruling body the iaaf is taking a cautious approach to contes allegations but contacted the us antidoping agency communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte for further information but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of contes television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely if it is felt there is case to answer it would be for its national governing body usa track and field to take the appropriate disciplinary action he added the us antidoping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its antidoping war and i am sure like ourselves they will be watching the television programme with great interest jones who is under investigation for steroid use by the us antidoping agency has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed jones who did not win any medals in athens in august has never failed a drugs test meanwhile conte who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering is due to face trial in march
