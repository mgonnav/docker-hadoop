entertainment_70.txt$bening makes awards breakthrough
entertainment_70.txt$film actress annette bening is up for an oscar for her starring role in the awardwinning film being julia
entertainment_70.txt$bening who was born in texas in 1958 has gained prominence for a string of key roles although an oscar has so far eluded her her status as one of hollywoods favourite actresses remains solid one of the biggest oscars buzzes in recent years was for benings role as troubled carolyn burnham in 1999s american beauty but her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of hilary swanks leading role in boys dont cry after opening her career in the theatre  and gaining a tony award nomination in 1986  bening had a lowkey spell in television she then made her film debut as a sexstarved wife in 1988s the great outdoors opposite comics dan akroyd and john candy
entertainment_70.txt$following a cameo in postcards from the edge benings breakthrough role came in 1990 playing seductive con artist myra langtry in the grifters  a role that won her an oscar nomination despite some rave reviews bening did not win the best supporting actress academy award
entertainment_70.txt$however the highprofile performance enabled bening to capture roles in a number of big budget hollywood productions costarring with some of hollywoods greatest players including robert de niro and harrison ford but it was her role opposite warren beatty in 1991 gangster flick bugsy which had the greatest impact bening played virginia hill another role which won her high critical acclaim but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 oscar nominations
entertainment_70.txt$bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for bening  she married beatty with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in europe the couple now have four children together a pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered benings career in the mid1990s she played michael douglas opposite number in romantic comedy the american president and as a fiery queen elizabeth i in a contemporary adaptation of shakespeares richard iii
entertainment_70.txt$bening was the first choice to play the female lead in american beauty director sam mendes film debut which was a critical and commercial success  but the actress had to be content with a bafta award for her strong performance but current film being julia has made bening an awardwinning actress rather than the perennial nominee with success at the golden globes the witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s london sees the eponymous theatrical diva  played by bening  grow tired of her success and fall for a young american  and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted academy award
