politics_282.txt$blair blasts tory spending plans
politics_282.txt$tony blair has launched an attack on conservative spending plans saying they are a ludicrous improbability
politics_282.txt$the prime minister has told a labour party gathering that the tory policies would cause economic failure tory leader michael howard has said his party would cut 35bn in wasteful spending to allow 4bn in tax cuts on saturday tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing inefficiencies which had burgeoned under labour in his speech mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party which had learned to occupy the political centre ground with a hidebound tory party which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts mr blair said the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk both britains hardwon economic stability  the lowest mortgages inflation unemployment for decades  and the key investment in public services
politics_282.txt$i believe that the tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as its possible to imagine he said its a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of conservative government mr blair added they the conservatives have learned nothing by contrast he said new labour had listened to its electorate and changed
politics_282.txt$mr blair went on to list his governments achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party so now we have a choice we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back and i say we have to fight in response david davis said the tories would make cuts such as removing regional assemblies but would bring in more police officers and match labours spending on health and education everybody knows having lived through this government the last seven years that they faced lots of stealth tactics lots of increases in taxes but no improvement in public services he said mr davis said labour had been responsible for huge waste huge overspending not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy the public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government less waste and lower taxes with a tory government he concluded
politics_282.txt$gordon brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors the chancellor said the conservatives plans would see some 50bn in spending cuts by 2011 which the tories deny mr brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be distracted or diverted according to an advance text released by officials he told delegates we must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the longterm decisions necessary to meet them
politics_282.txt$mr brown warned that the tories were planning the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto meanwhile tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of misrepresenting the partys proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans he still cannot accept the simple truth which is that we will spend more on what matters to people  schools hospitals and police  and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes mr letwin said once again mr blair and his chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election  which taxes will they put up to fill the 8bn shortfall in their plans
