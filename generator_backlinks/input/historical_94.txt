historical_94.txt$professor david welch explores nations reliance on propaganda in world war one with a focus on symbols and slogans of nationhood and patriotism
historical_94.txt$
historical_94.txt$the first world war was the first war in which the mass media played a significant part in disseminating news from the fighting front to the home front it was also the first war to target systematically produced government propaganda at the general public all the belligerents were therefore compelled to recognise that they had to justify the righteousness of the war and to this end themes such as patriotism and nationalism played an important role
historical_94.txt$your country needs you
historical_94.txt$the armies of continental europe were made up of conscripts who really had little choice about going to war in 1914 the british army by contrast was made up of professionals and then volunteers the british placed immense reliance therefore on propaganda to justify the war to the people to help promote recruitment into the armed forces and to convince the population that their sacrifices would be rewarded  one of the most enduring images of the war   much copied and parodied since  remains the distinctive recruitment poster of lord kitcheners heavily mustachioed face and intimidating finger imploring the british population that your country needs you stereotypes deeply embedded in national sentiment were invoked to justify britains entry into the war and british propaganda posters often employed the religious symbolism of st george slaying the german dragonbritish recruitment posters changed in tone from appealing to an individuals honour to mobilisation by shame savile lumleys famous poster of 1915 depicted two young children asking their father about his military prowess after the war daddy what did you do in the great war the emotional blackmail of using children to shame their elders into fighting was in fact employed by most of the belligerents women were also assigned the responsibility for ordering men into war perhaps the most well known in this genre is women of britain saygo

historical_94.txt$symbols of nationhood
historical_94.txt$once the initial euphoria war fever had subsided it was imperative to remind people both at home and in the trenches of what they were fighting for the major themes included a call to arms and a request for war loans as well as efforts to encourage industrial activity to explain national policies to channel emotions such as courage or hatred to urge the population to conserve resources and to inform the public of food and fuel substitutes
historical_94.txt$one tactic at a states disposal was the use of iconic figures to strengthen a particular point about national identity in order to promote patriotism these might be real people presented in a mythologised form as national heroes or they might come from old myths or popular folklore britannia john bull and the british bulldog the german eagle the french cockerel or the national emblem of france marianne   an allegorical encapsulation of liberty and reason
historical_94.txt$
historical_94.txt$an alternative strategy was the use of material symbols of nationhood indeed a state might have numerous opportunities at its disposal to create narratives and circulate images favourable to its preferred national story  in everyday items such as coins banknotes and postage stamps or symbolic structures such as statues monuments and buildings two of the most overt and powerful symbols which allow citizens to express their affinity with the state are the nations flag and its anthem
historical_94.txt$
historical_94.txt$the money motif
historical_94.txt$the need to raise money to pay for the war by means of war bonds or liberty bonds as they were known in the united states provided one of the most important patriotic themes for posters and for the new medium of film  a recurring related theme was the portrayal of money coins and banknotes as an active force in military engagement for example turn your silver into bullets  at the post office in france a similar poster designed by jules abel faivre in 1915 depicted a large gold coin with a gallic cockerel on it crushing a german soldier with the slogan deposit your gold for france  gold fights for victory

historical_94.txt$all sides therefore supplemented their military engagement with propaganda aimed at stimulating national sentiment by means of nationalistic slogans and patriotic calls to arms
