space_52.txt$first the short form authored by henry spencer then an official nasa
space_52.txt$announcement
space_52.txt$q how do i become an astronaut
space_52.txt$a we will assume you mean a nasa astronaut since its probably
space_52.txt$impossible for a nonrussian to get into the cosmonaut corps paying
space_52.txt$passengers are not professional cosmonauts and the other nations have
space_52.txt$so few astronauts and fly even fewer that youre better off hoping to
space_52.txt$win a lottery becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fastjet
space_52.txt$experience which means a military flying career forget that unless you
space_52.txt$want to do it anyway so you want to become a shuttle mission
space_52.txt$specialist
space_52.txt$if you arent a us citizen become one that is a must  after that
space_52.txt$the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly
space_52.txt$exceeds the supply  nasas problem is not finding qualified people
space_52.txt$but thinning the lineup down to manageable length	it is not enough
space_52.txt$to be qualified you must avoid being disqualified for any reason
space_52.txt$many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job
space_52.txt$get a phd  specialize in something that involves getting your hands
space_52.txt$dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil  forget computer
space_52.txt$programming entirely it will be done from the ground for the fore
space_52.txt$seeable future  degrees in one field plus work experience in
space_52.txt$another seems to be a frequent winner
space_52.txt$be in good physical condition with good eyesight	do not get a
space_52.txt$radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision nobody knows
space_52.txt$what sudden pressure changes would do to rked eyes and longterm
space_52.txt$effects are poorly understood  for that matter avoid any other
space_52.txt$significant medical unknowns  if you can pass a jetpilot physical
space_52.txt$you should be okay if you cant your chances are poor
space_52.txt$practise public speaking and be conservative and conformist in
space_52.txt$appearance and actions youve got a tough selling job ahead trying
space_52.txt$to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you
space_52.txt$are better than hundreds of other applicants  and also that you
space_52.txt$will be a credit to nasa after you are hired  public relations is
space_52.txt$a significant part of the job and nasas image is very prim and
space_52.txt$proper  the image you want is squeakyclean workaholic yuppie
space_52.txt$remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point
space_52.txt$and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent
space_52.txt$keep your nose clean
space_52.txt$get a pilots license and make flying your number one hobby
space_52.txt$experienced pilots are known to be favored even for nonpilot jobs
space_52.txt$work for nasa of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988
space_52.txt$43 were military or nasa employees and the remaining two were
space_52.txt$a nasa consultant and mae jemison the first black female astronaut
space_52.txt$if you apply from outside nasa and miss but they offer you a job
space_52.txt$at nasa take it sometimes in the past this has meant you
space_52.txt$do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first
space_52.txt$think space  they want highly motivated people so lose no chance
space_52.txt$to demonstrate motivation
space_52.txt$keep trying  many astronauts didnt make it the first time
