historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$the giza pyramids are that kind of historical site that just blows your mind the tallest of the three the great pyramid of khufu towers above the desert at 481 feet it was the tallest building on the planet for over 3800 years until the construction of englands lincoln cathedral in 1300
historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$the three giza pyramids are located on the outskirts of cairo they were built between 2550 and 2490 bc to serve as a mortuary temple for pharaohs khufu khefre and menkaure exactly how the pyramids were built and by whom remains a mystery today
historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$for years it was believed to be the work of slaves but it is now thought that the builders were probably skilled workers from all over the country the enigmatic sphinx was built by khefre and its meaning is still debated among historians
historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$you can tour the inside of two of the pyramids during your visit one of the three is always closed in order to limit the impact of tourism on these ancient structures
historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$saqqara  dhashur
historical_81.txt$giza is what immediately comes to mind when most people think about pyramids and the fact that such amazing structures were built 4500 years ago is truly mindblowing yet just a few miles away there are some pyramids that are even older
historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$the pyramids in saqqara and dhashur were built around 200 years before those at giza saqqara and dhashur were the necropolises of memphis the capital of egypt during the old kingdom theyre now a true treasure trove for archaeologists and anyone interested in egyptian history
historical_81.txt$

historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$karnak and luxor temples were once joined by an avenue lined with sphinxes which has been partially unearthed walking down this avenue in the early morning mist or after sunset when its all lit up will make you feel as if youre stepping in the footsteps of ancient history
historical_81.txt$

historical_81.txt$

historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$temple of hatshepsut
historical_81.txt$this temple is located just a short drive away from the valley of the kings it was built to honor of hatshepsut one of the few female pharaohs in egyptian history
historical_81.txt$

historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$temple of horus
historical_81.txt$another stunning temple located in the vicinity of the nile is the temple of horus in edfu
historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$this is very wellpreserved site because its far more recent than the luxor and karnak temples it was completed in the ptolemaic period between 237 and 57 bc another reason why this temple is in such good condition is that it was buried in sand for hundreds of years which contributed to preserving the carvings and wall paintings inside
historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$the temple is dedicated to horus the falcon god who is frequently portrayed in statues and wall decorations around the site it is also one of the few temples to survive with an intact ceiling

historical_81.txt$the most recognizable feature of both temples are the colossal statues youll find at the entrance the ramesses ii ones reach up to 65 feet
historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$abu simbel is unique because the two temples were about to disappear under the water of the aswan high dam forever before an international task force arranged to have them relocated
historical_81.txt$
historical_81.txt$the process ultimately took five years the two temples were carefully cut and reassembled in a safe location far away from the dam waters in what proved one of the most challenging projects of modern engineering margherita ragg
