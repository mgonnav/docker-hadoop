business_30.txt$call centre users lose patience
business_30.txt$customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up a survey suggests
business_30.txt$once past the welcome message callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music the drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20 every year customers are getting used to the idea of an always available society says cara diemont of it firm dimension data which commissioned the survey however call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls she says from just over 5 in 2003 to a record 133 during last year when automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages the number of abandoned calls is even higher  a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait one possible reason for the lack in patience ms diemont says is the fact that more customers are calling on the move using their mobile phones
business_30.txt$the surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres growing range of tasks once a call centre may have looked after mortgages now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards insurance and current accounts ms diemont says problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going handinhand with more training the survey found
business_30.txt$in what dimension data calls an alarming development the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days leaving agents not equipped to deal with customers this ms diemont warns is scary and not good for the bottom line either poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers as a result call centres have a high churn rate with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff resolution rates  the number of calls where a customers query is resolved to mutual satisfaction  are running at just 50 when the query is passed on to a second or third person  a specialist or manager  rates rise to about 70 but that is still well below the industry target of an 85 resolution rate
business_30.txt$suggestions that outsourcing  relocating call centres to lowcost countries like india or south africa  is to blame are wrong ms diemont says
business_30.txt$there are no big differences in wait time and call resolution between call centres based in europe or north america and those in developing countries around the world you can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place she says however companies that decide to offshore their operations are driven not just by cost considerations only 42 of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money but not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution nearly twothirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres they give three key reasons for not making the move
business_30.txt$ call centre operations are part of their business core function
business_30.txt$ they are worried about the risk of going abroad
business_30.txt$ they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive the survey was conducted by sunovate on behalf of dimension data and is based on indepth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents what are your experiences with call centres are you happy to listen to vivaldi or greensleeves or do you want an immediate response and if you work in a call centre did your training prepare you for your job
