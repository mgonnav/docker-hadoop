business_29.txt$uk risks breaking golden rule
business_29.txt$the uk government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its golden rule a report suggests
business_29.txt$the rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest and not to finance its spending projects the national institute of economic and social research niesr claims that taxes need to rise by about 10bn if state finances are to be put in order the treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008 according to niesr if the governments current economic cycle runs until march 2006 then it is unlikely the golden rule will be met should the cycle end a year earlier then the chances improve to 5050 either way fiscal tightening is needed niesr said

business_29.txt$growth in britain also is set to accelerate it forecast despite weak growth in the third quarter the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006 niesr said adding that the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery gdp is expected at 32 in 2004 and 28 in both 2005 and 2006 the main cloud on the horizon niesr said was the uks much analysed and fretted over property market
