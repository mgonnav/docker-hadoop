medical_645.txt$the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrialized
medical_645.txt$nations  we think hdlcholesterol increased because we increased the amount
medical_645.txt$of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolic
medical_645.txt$study  in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietary
medical_645.txt$cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption
medical_645.txt$in the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total
medical_645.txt$calories  we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflects
medical_645.txt$the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary
medical_645.txt$cholesterol  hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased
medical_645.txt$quite a bit in this study dr connor explains
medical_645.txt$low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of
medical_645.txt$coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of
medical_645.txt$fat or cholesterol  hdl remains an important predictor to americans because
medical_645.txt$of their usual high fat intake
medical_645.txt$dr connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than 20
medical_645.txt$percent of total calories as fat less than 100 mg of cholesterol and a csi
medical_645.txt$around 20 varying in accordance with caloric needs  such a diet is low in
medical_645.txt$meat and dairy fat high in fiber  dr connor also comments on recent
medical_645.txt$suggestions that americans adopt a mediterraneanstyle diet  the original
medical_645.txt$mediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of
medical_645.txt$fat and very few animal and dairy products  we are already eating a lot of
medical_645.txt$meat and dairy products  simply to continue that pattern while switching to
medical_645.txt$olive oil is not going to help the situation
medical_645.txt$the world health organization who is focusing much attention on the
medical_645.txt$emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies
medical_645.txt$undergoing technological development  dr connor says that coronary heart
medical_645.txt$disease starts with a given societys elite who typically eat a different
medical_645.txt$diet than the average citizen  if the pattern of afluence increases the
medical_645.txt$entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease
medical_645.txt$which places a termendous health care burden on a society  who would like the
medical_645.txt$developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can
medical_645.txt$concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public
medical_645.txt$health measures to improve general wellbeing rather than paying for
medical_645.txt$unnecessary expensive medical technology dr connors says
medical_645.txt$the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move
medical_645.txt$their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a highrisk range within a
medical_645.txt$very short time by an affluent excessive diet  the present rate of coronary
