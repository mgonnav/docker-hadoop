politics_326.txt$prime ministers questions
politics_326.txt$so who if anyone is playing politics with the security of the nation
politics_326.txt$michael howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who he claims is ramming through parliament the controversial new antiterror measures without proper debate he didnt say so but the tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election and they believe tony blair is using the issue to suggest the tories are soft on terrorism why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the tories offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws he demanded the prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament is not the opposition against to the proposed laws in principle in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless
politics_326.txt$what this is really about believes mr blair is the tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass maybe even defeat the government and that is more important to them than national security liberal democrat leader charles kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue he preferred to state that as with other issues like id cards the governments immediate instinct was authoritarian
politics_326.txt$as is his habit nowadays the prime minister was less rough with mr kennedy than he had been with mr howard  he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the lib dems have once again just missed the point apart from all that it was electioneering as usual the very first question to the prime minister from derby norths bob laxton asked him in effect if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools later birminghams sion simon even went so far as to suggest the tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now the prime minister almost blushed this was not the appropriate place to announce election day he stammered but can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away  an announcement coming in the week beginning 4 april for an election on 5 may is where the big money is in the commons and perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment
