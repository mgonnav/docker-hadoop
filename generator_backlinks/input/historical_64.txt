historical_64.txt$although the opening of the archives of the ministry of foreign affairs after a 30year lockup enabled some new historical research on the war including jeancharles jauffrets book la guerre dalgérie par les documents the algerian war according to the documents many remain inaccessible106 the recognition in 1999 by the national assembly permitted the algerian war at last to enter the syllabi of french schools in france the war was known as la guerre sans nom the war without a name while it was being fought as the government variously described the war as the algerian events the algerian problem and the algerian dispute the mission of the french army was ensuring security maintaining order and pacification but was never described as fighting a war while the fln were referred to as criminals bandits outlaws terrorists and fellagha a derogatory arabic word meaning roadcutters but which was popularly mistranslated as throatcuttersa reference to the flns favorite method of execution namely making people wear the kabylian smile by cutting their throats pulling their tongues out and leaving them to bleed to death107 after reports of the widespread use of torture by french forces started to reach france in 195657 the war become commonly known as la sale guerre the dirty war a term that is still used today and which reflects the very negative memory of the war in france107145

historical_64.txt$as the war was officially a police action for decades no monuments were built to honor the about 25000 french soldiers killed in the war while the defense ministry refused to classify veterans as veterans until the 1970s54219 when a monument to the unknown soldier of the algerian war was erected in 1977 the french president valéry giscard destaing in his dedication speech refused to use the words war or algeria instead using the phrase the unknown soldier of north africa54219 a national monument to the french war dead was not built until 1996 and even then spoke only of those killed fighting in afrique du nord and was located in a decrepit area of paris rarely visited by tourists as if to hide the monument54226 further adding to the silence were the vested interests of french politicians françois mitterrand the socialist president 198195 had been the interior minister 195455 and the justice minister 195557 during which time he had been deeply involved in the repression of the fln and it was only after mitterrands death in 1996 that socialists started to become willing to talk about the war and even then remaining very guarded about mitterrands role54232 likewise de gaulle had promised in the evian accords that the piedsnoirs could remain in algeria but after independence the fln had freely violated the accords leading to the entire piednoir population fleeing to france usually with only the clothes they were wearing as they had lost everything they had in algeria54232 for gaullists this was not exactly a shining moment to cherish54232

historical_64.txt$in english british and american historians tended to see the fln as freedom fighters with the french being condemned as imperialists108 one of the first books about the war in english a scattering of dust by american journalist herb greer depicted the algerian struggle for independence in a very sympathetic way1082201 most work in english done in the 1960s and 1970s usually the work of leftwing scholars focused on explaining the fln as a part of a generational change in algerian nationalism and depicted the war as either a reaction to intolerable racist oppression andor an attempt by peasantry impoverished by french policies to improve their lot1082225 one of the few military histories of the war was the algerian insurrection by a retired british army officer edgar oballance who wrote with frank admiration for french tactics in algeria seeing the fln as a terrorist group that needed to be suppressed and concluded that the tactics that won the war militarily lost the war politically1082256

historical_64.txt$in 1977 the british historian alistair horne published a savage war of peace which is generally regarded as the leading book written on the subject in english though written from a french perspective rather the algerian108226 after 15 years horne was not concerned about right or wrong but with cause and effect10821735 a francophile who lived in paris at the time of the war horne had condemned the suez war and the french bombing of the tunisian village of sakiet sidi youssef in 1958 arguing that the inflexibility of the fln had won algeria independence and created a sense of algerian national identity leading to rule by authoritarian but progressive fln regime10821735 the american journalist adam shatz wrote not surprisingly the best single survey of the war is by an english journalist alistair horne whose masterful a savage war of peace published in 1977 still has no equal in french63

historical_64.txt$in a 1977 column published in the times literacy supplement reviewing the book a savage war of peace by alistair horne the iraqiborn british historian elie kedourie vigorously attacked horne as an apologist for terrorism accusing him of engaging the cosy pieties of bienpensants as kedorie condemned those western intellectuals who excused terrorism when committed by third world revolutionaries10821735 kedourie claimed that far from a mass movement the fln were a small gang of murderous intellectuals who used brutally terroristic tactics against the french and any muslim who was loyal to the french whom the french had beaten back by 1959108217235 kedourie charged that de gaulle had cynically sacrificed the colons and the harkis as kedourie charged that de gaulle had chosen to disregard his constitutional oath as president to protect all the french to ensure that the french withdrew and handed over power to the only organized body of armed men who were on the scenea civilized government thus acting for all the world like the votary of some mao or ho in the barbarous belief that legitimacy comes from the power of the gun108227

historical_64.txt$before the war algeria was a favored setting for french films with the british french professor leslie hill having written in the late 1920s and 1930s for instance north africa provided filmmakers in france with a ready fund of familiar images of the exotics mingling for instance the languid eroticism of arabian nights with the infinite and hazy vistas of the sahara to create a powerful confection of tragic heroism and passionate love107147 during the war itself french censors banned the entire subject of the war1071478 since 1962 when film censorship relating to the war eased french films dealing with the conflict have consistently portrayed the war as a set of conflicting memories and rival narratives of which only some may be true but which ones is left unclear with most films dealing with the war taking a disjointed chronological structure where scenes before during and after the war are juxtaposed out of sequence with one film critic referring to the cinematic algeria as an ambiguous world marked by the displacements and repetitions of dreams10714258 the consistent message of french films dealing with the war is that something horrible happened but just what happened who was involved and why being left unexplained107142158 though atrocities especially torture by french forces are acknowledged the french soldiers who fought in algeria were and are always portrayed in french cinema as the lost soldiers tragic victims of the war who are more deserving of sympathy than the fln people they tortured almost invariably portrayed as vicious psychopathic terrorists  an approach to the war that has raised anger in algeria1071516

historical_64.txt$in 1992 the american john ruedy published modern algeria origins and development of a nation1082323 ruedy wrote under french rule the traditional social structure had been so completely destroyed that when the fln launched its independence struggle in 1954 the only way of asserting ones interests was the law of the gun which explains why the fln was so violent not only in regards to its enemies but also within the movement forming the basis of an alternative political culture based on brute force that persists to this day108233

historical_64.txt$on 15 june 2000 le monde published an interview with louisette ighilahriz a former fln member who described in graphic detail her torture at the hands of the french army and made the sensational claim that the war heroes general jacques massu and general marcel bigeard had personally been present when she being tortured for information54233 what made the interview very touching for many french people was that ighilahriz was not demanding vengeance but rather wished to express thanks to dr françois richaud the army doctor who extended her much kindness and whom she believed saved her life by treating her every time she was tortured asking if it were possible for her to see dr richaud one last time to thank him personally dr richaud it turned out had died in 199754233 as ighilahriz had been an attractive woman in her youth universityeducated secular fluent in french and fond of quoting victor hugo and her duties in the fln had been as an information courier she made for a most sympathetic victim as she was a woman did not come across as algerian54234 william cohen commented had she been an uneducated man who had been involved in killings and was not coming forward to express thanks for a frenchman her story might not had resonated the same way54234 the ighiahriz case led to a public letter signed by 12 people who been involved in the war to president chirac asking that october 31 be made a public day of remembrance for victims of torture in algeria54234 in response to the ighilahriz case general paul aussaresses gave an interview on 23 november 2000 in which he candidly admitted to ordering torture and extrajudicial executions stating he had personally executed 24 fellagha which he argued were justified as torture and extrajudicial executions were the only way to defeat the fln54235 in may 2001 general aussaresses published his memoirs services spéciaux algérie 19551957 in which presented a detailed account of torture and extrajudicial killings in the name of the republic which he wrote were all done under orders from paris confirming what had been long suspected54239 as a result of these interviews and aussaressess book the algerian war was finally extensively discussed by the french media who had ignored the subject as much as possible for decades through no consensus emerged about how to best remember the war54235 adding to the interest was the decision by one war veteran georges fogel to come forward to confirm that he had seen ighiahriz and many others tortured in 1957 while the politician and war veteran jean marie faure decided in february 2001 to release extracts from the diary he kept at the time showing acts of sadism and horror he had witnessed54235 the french historian pierre vidalnaquet called this a moment of catharsis that was explainable only in nearfrench terms it is the return of the repressed542356

historical_64.txt$the algerian war remains a contentious event today according to historian benjamin stora one of the leading historians on the algerian war memories concerning the war remain fragmented with no common ground to speak of
historical_64.txt$
historical_64.txt$there is no such thing as a history of the algerian war there is just a multitude of histories and personal paths through it everyone involved considers that they lived through it in their own way and any attempt to understand the algerian war globally is immediately rejected by protagonists109
historical_64.txt$
historical_64.txt$even though stora has counted 3000 publications in french on the algerian war there still is no work produced by french and algerian authors cooperating with one another even though according to stora there can no longer be talk about a war without a name a number of problems remain especially the absence of sites in france to commemorate the war furthermore conflicts have arisen on an exact commemoration date to end the war although many sources as well as the french state place it on 19 march 1962 the evian agreements others point out that the massacres of harkis and the kidnapping of piedsnoirs took place afterwards stora further points out the phase of memorial reconciliation between the two sides of the sea is still a long way off109 this was evidenced by the national assemblys creation of the law on colonialism on 23 february 2005 which asserted that colonialism had overall been positive

historical_64.txt$alongside a heated debate in france the february 23 2005 law had the effect of jeopardizing the treaty of friendship that president jacques chirac was supposed to sign with president abdelaziz bouteflikaa treaty no longer on the agenda following this controversial law bouteflika has talked about a cultural genocide particularly referring to the 1945 sétif massacre chirac finally had the law repealed through a complex institutional mechanism
historical_64.txt$
historical_64.txt$another matter concerns the teaching of the war as well as of colonialism and decolonization in particular in french secondary schools110 hence there is only one reference to racism in a french textbook one published by bréal publishers for terminales students those passing their baccalauréat thus many are not surprised that the first to speak about the october 17 1961 massacre were music bands including but not only hiphop bands such as the famous suprême ntm les arabes dans la seine or politically engaged la rumeur indeed the algerian war is not even the subject of a specific chapter in textbook for terminales106 henceforth benjamin stora stated
historical_64.txt$
historical_64.txt$as algerians do not appear in an indigenous condition and their subcitizens status as the history of nationalist movement is never evoked as their being one of great figures of the resistance such as messali hadj and ferhat abbas they neither emerge nor are being given attention no one is explaining to students what colonization has been we have prevented students from understanding why the decolonization took place106
