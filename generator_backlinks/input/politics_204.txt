politics_204.txt$correction agency plans dropped
politics_204.txt$plans to create a single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped
politics_204.txt$the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments the national correctional agency would have provided a onestop justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition instead scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending
politics_204.txt$scotlands reoffending rate is high with more than 60 of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail this is leading to an everexpanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem ministers thought merging the prison service with the councilcontrolled criminal justice social work departments which provide community sentences might have provided an answer however following a consultation on the idea justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans instead ms jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system
politics_204.txt$she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday aiming to break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community the new measures will place a new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the spss role and performance in reducing reoffending the minister said better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there communities who are paying the price for this reoffending  both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs  expect better it costs the taxpayer 35000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison therefore as we continue to invest in the service it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves to ministers and to parliament
