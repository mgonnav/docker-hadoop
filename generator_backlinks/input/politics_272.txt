politics_272.txt$kennedy looks to election gains
politics_272.txt$they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics  the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition
politics_272.txt$but the liberal democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they not the tories who are now the real threat to labour as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a fading force and he insisted there was no limit to his partys ambitions in the coming poll and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test
politics_272.txt$and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the partys westminster hq he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election
politics_272.txt$the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow  as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson  that only his party offered a genuine alternative on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than 100000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election
politics_272.txt$there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as selfdelusion that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats
politics_272.txt$labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name
