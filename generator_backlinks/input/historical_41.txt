historical_41.txt$the summer of 1916 saw the longdeferred confrontation of germanys high seas fleet and great britains grand fleet in the battle of jutlandhistorys biggest naval battle which both sides claimed as a victory
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$admiral reinhard scheer who became commander in chief of the high seas fleet in january 1916 planned to contrive an encounter on the open sea between his fleet and some part of the british fleet in separation from the whole so that the germans could exploit their momentary superiority in numbers to achieve victory scheers plan was to ensnare admiral beattys squadron of battle cruisers at rosyth midway up britains eastern coast by stratagem and destroy it before any reinforcements from the grand fleets main base at scapa flow could reach it
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$to set the trap five battle cruisers of the german high seas fleet together with four light cruisers were to sail northward under hippers command from wilhelmshaven ger to a point off the southwestern coast of norway scheer himself with the battle squadrons of the high seas fleet was to follow 50 miles behind to catch beattys forces in the gap once they had been lured eastward across the north sea in pursuit of hipper but the signal for the german operation to begin made in the afternoon of may 30 was intercepted and partially decoded by the british and before midnight the whole british grand fleet was on its way to a rendezvous off norways southwestern coast and roughly across the planned route of the german fleet
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$at 220 pm on may 31 when admiral john jellicoes grand fleet squadrons from scapa flow were still 65 miles away to the north beattys advance guard of light cruisersfive miles ahead of his heavier shipsand hippers scouting group learned quite accidentally of one anothers proximity an hour later the two lines were drawn up for battle and in the next 50 minutes the british suffered severely and the indefatigable was sunk when beattys battle cruisers came up however the german cruisers in their turn sustained such damage that hipper sent a protective screen of german destroyers in to launch a torpedo attack the british had lost another battle cruiser the queen mary before the german high seas fleet was sighted by a british patrol to the south at 435 pm on this report beatty ordered his ships northward to lure the germans toward the grand fleet under jellicoes command
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$not until 614 pm after jellicoes squadrons and beattys had been within sight of one another for nearly a quarter of an hour was the german fleet precisely locatedonly just in time for jellicoe to deploy his ships to the best advantage jellicoe arrayed the grand fleet endtoend in a line so that their combined broadsides could be brought to bear on the approaching german ships who could in turn reply only with the forward guns of their leading ships the british ships in effect formed the horizontal stroke and the german ships the vertical stroke of the letter t with the british having deployed into line at a right angle to the german ships forward progress this maneuver was in fact known as crossing the enemys t and was the ideal situation dreamed of by the tacticians of both navies since by crossing the t ones forces temporarily gained an overwhelming superiority of firepower
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$for the germans this was a moment of unparalleled risk three factors helped prevent the destruction of the german ships in this trap their own excellent construction the steadiness and discipline of their crews and the poor quality of the british shells the lützow the derfflinger and the battleship könig led the line and were under broadside fire from some 10 british battleships yet their main guns remained undamaged and they fought back to such effect that one of their salvoes fell full on the invincible and blew it up this success however did little to relieve the intense bombardment from the other british ships and the german fleet was still pressing forward into the steel trap of the grand fleet
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$relying on the magnificent seamanship of the german crews scheer extricated his fleet from the appalling danger into which it had run by a simple but in practice extremely difficult maneuver at 630 pm he ordered a turn of 180 for all his ships at once it was executed without collision and the german battleships reversed course in unison and steamed out of the jaws of the trap while german destroyers spread a smoke screen across their rear the smoke and worsening visibility left jellicoe in doubt about what had happened and the british had lost contact with the germans by 645 pm
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$yet the british grand fleet had maneuvered in such a way that it ended up between the german high seas fleet and the german ports and this was the situation scheer most dreaded so at 655 pm scheer ordered another reverse turn perhaps hoping to pass around the rear of the british fleet but the result for him was a worse position than that from which he had just escaped his battle line had become compressed and his leading ships found themselves again under intense bombardment from the broadside array of the british ships jellicoe had succeeded in crossing the germans t again the lützow now received irreparable damage and many other german ships were damaged at this point at 715 pm therefore to cause a diversion and win time scheer ordered his battle cruisers and destroyers ahead to virtually immolate themselves in a massed charge against the british ships
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$this was the crisis of the battle of jutland as the german battle cruisers and destroyers steamed forward the german battleships astern became confused and disorganized in trying to execute their reverse turn had jellicoe ordered the grand fleet forward through the screen of charging german battle cruisers at that moment the fate of the german high seas fleet would likely have been sealed as it was fearing and overestimating the danger of torpedo attacks from the approaching destroyers he ordered his fleet to turn away and the two lines of battleships steamed apart at a speed of more than 20 knots they did not meet again and when darkness fell jellicoe could not be sure of the route of the german retreat by 300 am on june 1 the germans had safely eluded their pursuers
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$the british had sustained greater losses than the germans in both ships and men in all the british lost three battle cruisers three cruisers eight destroyers and 6274 officers and men in the battle of jutland the germans lost one battleship one battle cruiser four light cruisers five destroyers and 2545 officers and men the losses inflicted on the british however were not enough to affect the numerical superiority of their fleet over the german in the north sea where their domination remained practically unchallengeable during the course of the war henceforth the german high seas fleet chose not to venture out from the safety of its home ports

historical_41.txt$the eastern front 1916
historical_41.txt$in the hope of diverting german strength from the attack at verdun on the western front the russians gallantly but prematurely opened an offensive north and south of lake naroch narocz east of vilna on march 18 1916 and continued it until march 27 though they won very little ground at great cost and only for a short time they then reverted to preparations for a major offensive in july the main blow it was planned should be delivered by ae everts central group of armies assisted by an inward movement of an kuropatkins army in the northern sector of the front but at the same time aa brusilovs southwestern army group was authorized to make a supposedly diversionary attack in its own sectors in the event brusilovs attack became by far the more important operation of the offensive
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$surprised by the austrians asiago offensive in may italy promptly appealed to the russians for action to draw the enemys reserves away from the italian fronts and the russians responded by advancing their timetable again brusilov undertook to start his attack on june 4 on the understanding that everts should be launched 10 days later
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$thus began an offensive on the eastern front that was to be imperial russias last really effective military effort popularly known as brusilovs offensive it had such an astonishing initial success as to revive allied dreams about the irresistible russian steamroller instead its ultimate achievement was to sound the death knell of the russian monarchy brusilovs four armies were distributed along a very wide front with lutsk at the northern end tarnopol and buchach buczacz in the central sector and czernowitz at the southern end having struck first in the tarnopol and czernowitz sectors on june 4 brusilov on june 5 took the austrians wholly by surprise when he launched am kaledins army toward lutsk the defenses crumbled at once and the attackers pushed their way between two austrian armies as the offensive was developed the russians were equally successful in the buchach sector and in their thrust into bukovina which culminated in the capture of czernowitz by june 20 brusilovs forces had captured 200000 prisoners
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$evert and kuropatkin however instead of striking in accordance with the agreed plan found excuses for procrastination the russian chief of general staff mv alekseyev therefore tried to transfer this inert couples reserves to brusilov but the russians lateral communications were so poor that the germans had time to reinforce the austrians before brusilov was strong enough to make the most of his victory though his forces in bukovina advanced as far as the carpathian mountains a counterstroke by alexander von linsingens germans in the lutsk sector checked russian progress at the decisive point further russian drives from the centre of brusilovs front were launched in july but by early september the opportunity of exploiting the summers victory was lost brusilov had driven the austrians from bukovina and from much of eastern galicia and had inflicted huge losses of men and equipment on them but he had depleted russias armies by about 1000000 men in doing so a large portion of this number consisted of deserters or prisoners this loss seriously undermined both the morale and the material strength of russia brusilovs offensive also had indirect results of great consequence first it had compelled the germans to withdraw at least seven divisions from the western front where they could ill be spared from the verdun and somme battles second it hastened romanias unfortunate entry into the war
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$disregarding romanias military backwardness the romanian government of ionel brătianu declared war against austriahungary on aug 27 1916 in entering the war romania succumbed to the allies offers of austrohungarian territory and to the belief that the central powers would be too much preoccupied with other fronts to mount any serious riposte against a romanian offensive some 12 of romanias 23 divisions in three columns thus began on august 28 a slow westward advance across transylvania where at first there were only five austrohungarian divisions to oppose them
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$the riposte of the central powers was swifter than the progress of the invasion germany turkey and bulgaria declared war against romania on august 28 august 30 and september 1 respectively and falkenhayn had plans already prepared though the miscarriage of his overall program for the year led to his being replaced by hindenburg as chief of the german general staff on august 29 falkenhayns recommendation that mackensen should direct a bulgarian attack on southern romania was approved and falkenhayn himself went to command on the transylvanian front for which five german as well as two more austrian divisions were found available as reinforcements
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$mackensens forces from bulgaria stormed the turtucaia tutrakan bridgehead on the danube southeast of bucharest on september 5 his subsequent advance eastward into the dobruja caused the romanians to switch their reserves to that quarter instead of reinforcing their transylvanian enterprise which thereupon came to a halt falkenhayn soon attacked first at the southern end of the 200mile front where he threw one of the romanian columns back into the roter turm turnu roşu pass then in the centre where by october 9 he had defeated another at kronstadt braşov for a month however the romanians withstood falkenhayns attempts to drive them out of the vulcan and szurduk surduc passes into walachia but just before winter snows blocked the way the germans took the two passes and advanced southward to tîrgu jiu where they won another victory then mackensen having turned westward from the dobruja crossed the danube near bucharest on which his and falkenhayns armies converged bucharest fell on december 6 and the romanian army a crippled force could only fall back northeastward into moldavia where it had the belated support of russian troops the central powers had access to romanias wheat fields and oil wells and the russians had 300 more miles of front to defend
historical_41.txt$german strategy and the submarine war 1916january 1917
historical_41.txt$both admiral scheer and general falkenhayn doubted whether the german submarines could do any decisive damage to great britain so long as their warfare was restricted in deference to the protests of the united states and after a tentative reopening of the submarine campaign on feb 4 1916 the german naval authorities in march gave the uboats permission to sink without warning all ships except passenger vessels the german civilian statesmen however who paid due attention to their diplomats warnings about us opinion were soon able to prevail over the generals and the admirals on may 4 the scope of the submarine campaign was again severely restricted
historical_41.txt$
historical_41.txt$the controversy between the statesmen and the advocates of unrestricted warfare was not dead yet hindenburg chief of the general staff from august 29 had ludendorff as his quartermaster general and ludendorff was quickly won over to supporting the chief of the admiralty staff henning von holtzendorff in his arguments against the german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg and the foreign minister gottlieb von jagow whereas bethmann and some other statesmen were hoping for a negotiated peace see below hindenburg and ludendorff were committed to a military victory the british naval blockade however threatened to starve germany into collapse before a military victory could be achieved and soon hindenburg and ludendorff got their way it was decided that from feb 1 1917 submarine warfare should be unrestricted and overtly so
