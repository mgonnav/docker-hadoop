medical_485.txt$mice  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common
medical_485.txt$infections  the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals immune
medical_485.txt$systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the
medical_485.txt$skin lesions dr kopp said
medical_485.txt$further proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists
medical_485.txt$exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light  the light increased hiv

medical_485.txt$papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity proved the
