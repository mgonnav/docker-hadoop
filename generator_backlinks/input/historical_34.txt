historical_34.txt$on the eastern front greater distances and quite considerable differences between the equipment and quality of the opposing armies ensured a fluidity of the front that was lacking in the west trench lines might form but to break them was not difficult particularly for the german army and then mobile operations of the old style could be undertaken
historical_34.txt$
historical_34.txt$urged by the french to take offensive action against the germans the russian commander in chief grand duke nicholas took it loyally but prematurely before the cumbrous russian war machine was ready by launching a pincer movement against east prussia under the higher control of general yag zhilinsky two armies the 1st or vilna army under pk rennenkampf and the 2nd or warsaw army under av samsonov were to converge with a twotoone superiority in numbers on the german 8th army in east prussia from the east and the south respectively rennenkampfs left flank would be separated by 50 miles from samsonovs right flank
historical_34.txt$
historical_34.txt$max von prittwitz und gaffron commander of the 8th army with his headquarters at neidenburg nidzica had seven divisions and one cavalry division on his eastern front but only the three divisions of friedrich von scholtzs xx corps on his southern he was therefore dismayed to learn on august 20 when the bulk of his forces had been repulsed at gumbinnen august 1920 by rennenkampfs attack from the east that samsonovs 13 divisions had crossed the southern frontier of east prussia and were thus threatening his rear he initially considered a general retreat but when his staff objected to this he approved their counterproposal of an attack on samsonovs left flank for which purpose three divisions were to be switched in haste by rail from the gumbinnen front to reinforce scholtz the rest of the gumbinnen troops could make their retreat by road the principal exponent of this counterproposal was lieutenant colonel max hoffmann prittwitz having moved his headquarters northward to mühlhausen młynary was surprised on august 22 by a telegram announcing that general paul von hindenburg with ludendorff as his chief of staff was coming to supersede him in command arriving the next day ludendorff readily confirmed hoffmanns dispositions for the blow at samsonovs left
historical_34.txt$
historical_34.txt$meanwhile zhilinsky was not only giving rennenkampf time to reorganize after gumbinnen but even instructing him to invest königsberg instead of pressing on to the west when the germans on august 25 learned from an intercepted russian wireless message the russians habitually transmitted combat directives in clear not in code that rennenkampf was in no hurry to advance ludendorff saw a new opportunity developing the plan put forward by hoffmann ludendorff concentrated about six divisions against samsonovs left wing this force inferior in strength could not have been decisive but ludendorff then took the calculated risk of withdrawing the rest of the german troops except for a cavalry screen from their confrontation with rennenkampf and rushing them southwestward against samsonovs right wing thus august von mackensens xvii corps was taken from near gumbinnen and moved southward to duplicate the planned german attack on samsonovs left with an attack on his right thus completely enveloping the russian 2nd army this daring move was made possible by the notable absence of communication between the two russian field commanders whom hoffmann knew to personally dislike each other under the germans converging blows samsonovs flanks were crushed and his centre surrounded during august 2631 the outcome of this military masterpiece called the battle of tannenberg was the destruction or capture of almost the whole of samsonovs army the history of imperial russias unfortunate participation in world war i is epitomized in the ignominious outcome of the battle of tannenberg
historical_34.txt$
historical_34.txt$the progress of the battle was as follows samsonov his forces spread out along a front 60 miles long was gradually pushing scholtz back toward the allensteinosterode olsztynostróda line when on august 26 ludendorff ordered general hermann von françois with the i corps on scholtzs right to attack samsonovs left wing near usdau uzdowo there on august 27 german artillery bombardments threw the hungry and weary russians into precipitate flight françois started to pursue them toward neidenburg in the rear of the russian centre and then made a momentary diversion southward to check a russian counterattack from soldau działdowo two of the russian 2nd armys six army corps managed to escape southeastward at this point and françois then resumed his pursuit to the east by nightfall on august 29 his troops were in control of the road leading from neidenburg eastward to willenberg wielbark the russian centre amounting to three army corps was now caught in the maze of forest between allenstein and the frontier of russian poland it had no line of retreat was surrounded by the germans and soon dissolved into mobs of hungry and exhausted men who beat feebly against the encircling german ring and then allowed themselves to be taken prisoner by the thousands samsonov shot himself in despair on august 29 by the end of august the germans had taken 92000 prisoners and annihilated half of the russian 2nd army ludendorffs bold recall of the last german forces facing rennenkampfs army was wholly justified in the event since rennenkampf remained utterly passive while samsonovs army was surrounded
historical_34.txt$
historical_34.txt$having received two fresh army corps seven divisions from the western front the germans now turned on the slowly advancing 1st army under rennenkampf the latter was attacked on a line extending from east of königsberg to the southern end of the chain of the masurian lakes during september 115 and was driven from east prussia as a result of these east prussian battles russia had lost about 250000 men and what could be afforded still less much war matériel but the invasion of east prussia had at least helped to make possible the french comeback on the marne by causing the dispatch of two german army corps from the western front
historical_34.txt$
historical_34.txt$having ended the russian threat to east prussia the germans could afford to switch the bulk of their forces from that area to the częstochowakraków front in southwestern poland where the austrian offensive launched on august 20 had been rolled back by russian counterattacks a new plan for simultaneous thrusts by the germans toward warsaw and by the austrians toward przemyśl was brought to nothing by the end of october as the russians could now mount counterattacks in overwhelming strength their mobilization being at last nearly completed the russians then mounted a powerful effort to invade prussian silesia with a huge phalanx of seven armies allied hopes rose high as the muchheralded russian steamroller as the huge russian army was called began its ponderous advance the russian armies were advancing toward silesia when hindenburg and ludendorff in november exploited the superiority of the german railway network when the retreating german forces had crossed the frontier back into prussian silesia they were promptly moved northward into prussian poland and thence sent southeastward to drive a wedge between the two armies of the russian right flank the massive russian operation against silesia was disorganized and within a week four new german army corps had arrived from the western front ludendorff was able to use them to press the russians back by middecember to the bzurarawka rivers line in front of warsaw and the depletion of their munition supplies compelled the russians to also fall back in galicia to trench lines along the nida and dunajec rivers

historical_34.txt$the first austrian invasion of serbia was launched with numerical inferiority part of one of the armies originally destined for the balkan front having been diverted to the eastern front on august 18 and the able serbian commander radomir putnik brought the invasion to an early end by his victories on the cer mountain august 1520 and at šabac august 2124 in early september however putniks subsequent northward offensive on the sava river in the north had to be broken off when the austrians began a second offensive against the serbs western front on the drina river after some weeks of deadlock the austrians began a third offensive which had some success in the battle of the kolubara and forced the serbs to evacuate belgrade on november 30 but by december 15 a serbian counterattack had retaken belgrade and forced the austrians to retreat mud and exhaustion kept the serbs from turning the austrian retreat into a rout but the victory sufficed to allow serbia a long spell of freedom from further austrian advances

historical_34.txt$the turkish entry
historical_34.txt$the entry of turkey or the ottoman empire as it was then called into the war as a german ally was the one great success of german wartime diplomacy since 1909 turkey had been under the control of the young turks over whom germany had skillfully gained a dominating influence german military instructors permeated the turkish army and enver paşa the leader of the young turks saw alliance with germany as the best way of serving turkeys interests in particular for protection against the russian threat to the straits he therefore persuaded the grand vizier said halim paşa to make a secret treaty negotiated late in july signed on august 2 pledging turkey to the german side if germany should have to take austriahungarys side against russia the unforeseen entry of great britain into the war against germany alarmed the turks but the timely arrival of two german warships the goeben and the breslau in the dardanelles on august 10 turned the scales in favour of envers policy the ships were ostensibly sold to turkey but they retained their german crews the turks began detaining british ships and more antibritish provocations followed both in the straits and on the egyptian frontier finally the goeben led the turkish fleet across the black sea to bombard odessa and other russian ports october 2930 russia declared war against turkey on november 1 and the western allies after an ineffective bombardment of the outer forts of the dardanelles on november 3 declared war likewise on november 5 a british force from india occupied basra on the persian gulf on november 21 in the winter of 191415 turkish offensives in the caucasus and in the sinai desert albeit abortive served german strategy well by tying russian and british forces down in those peripheral areas
