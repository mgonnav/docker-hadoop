politics_193.txt$tories attack eu asylum moves
politics_193.txt$david blunkett has been accused of using the politics of confusion to disguise new eu immigration measures
politics_193.txt$tory spokesman david davis told mps the uk was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to britain the eu has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area  previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states mr blunkett told mps the uk would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with
politics_193.txt$he argued closer cooperation with europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the uk if we dont like what other eu countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to optin or out to suit the british people he said the home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his tory opposite number mr davis the government is employing the politics of confusion  i think deliberately argued mr davis by confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto on monday tony blair insisted closer cooperation did not mean losing control of british borders he said an enlarged 25member eu needs a streamlined decision making process mr davis said once britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out  leaving the uk open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant
politics_193.txt$he accused the government of being pathetic when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of surrendering on the issue and he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the eu constitution which voters in the uk had been promised a referendum over mr blair told his monthly news conference britain had the best of both worlds and would keep the veto there is no question of britain giving up our veto on our border controls he said with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe mr blunkett met his eu counterparts in luxembourg on monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue
politics_193.txt$the 25 memberstates are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy in favour of the qualified majority voting qmv system under this scheme larger states such as britain are expected to have more power than the smaller eu states britain is expected to retain an optin right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a european asylum solution if we dont work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours said mr oaten the liberal democrats have long argued that britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but its right that we dont do this in isolation
