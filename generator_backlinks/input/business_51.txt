business_51.txt$japans ageing workforce built to last
business_51.txt$in his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties and the 101yearold torao toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life
business_51.txt$mr toshitsune is one of japans 23000 centenarians  a club that is growing by 13 annually and where the oldest member is 114 at his neat osaka detached house where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony between tasks this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is well whats most important for me is to be japans number one mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone and when it comes to longevity japan as a country appears to be doing just that women can expect to live until 85 men until 78 four years longer than americans and europeans
business_51.txt$on the outskirts of kyoto 83yearold yuji shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends who are in their seventies
business_51.txt$i think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved he remarks on average we can live longer whether its the diet or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined or just something in the genes japans elderly are remarkable but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu his grandchildren have huge problems ahead japan is the worlds least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us
business_51.txt$by 2007 japans population is expected to peak at 127 million then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century this means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled
business_51.txt$in the year 2050 if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30 of the population explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo so how will japans finances stay on track after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending the public sector debt is already about 140 of the countrys gross domestic product gdp the highest rate among industrialised countries the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010 the cost of running japans welfare state will double to more than 5 of gdp while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2 but unfortunately japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically glen wood vice president of deutsche securities japan asks whos going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker who is going to build the economy who are going to be the leaders who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward one option is further welfare reform another is immigration possibly from the philippines and indonesia but so far any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff
business_51.txt$standing next to tokyo harbour is a version of new yorks statue of liberty but as yet japan is not ready for an ellis island
business_51.txt$japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think its an option thats becoming more and more plausible and necessary insists mr wood in japan as in europe which also faces a workforce decline immigration is a very sensitive subject but for the japanese economy facing 8 fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars hitech kit and home appliances perhaps even another property crash
business_51.txt$of course the japanese could always have more children the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia but there would be no pay back until 2030 when todays babies are taxpayers and the demographic crisis like in europe starts to unfold in 2010 in contrast to japan  and of course the european union  the us population is expected to increase by 46 to 420 million by the middle of the century although president bush must redevise social security to take account of a 130 rise in americas over 65s the imf foresees a positive contribution to the us current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration
business_51.txt$some voices in japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the japanese labour market they want a shift towards financial services though doubts persist over the countrys ability let alone willingness to move away from manufacturing japan still has problems getting a viable banking system let alone shifting their auto business or their semiconductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas says mr wood japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency come 2020 japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power there are fears that the worlds number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession but none of this is mr toshitsunes concern anymore at 101 he chuckles that he feels fine
