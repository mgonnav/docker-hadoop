medical_487.txt$again thank you to all who gave
medical_487.txt$i have been using wordscan plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to
medical_487.txt$review the product  wordscan plus is a product of calera recognition systems
medical_487.txt$it runs under windows 31 and supports that accufont technology of the hewlett
medical_487.txt$packard scanners
medical_487.txt$when initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options
medical_487.txt$1 text  graphics 2 input source ie scanner fax file disk file 3
medical_487.txt$automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image
medical_487.txt$i like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which
medical_487.txt$parts of the document i would like scanned and in what order
medical_487.txt$once an image is scanned you can bring up the popup image verification  the
medical_487.txt$software gives you two errors at this point  blue which are words that were
medical_487.txt$converted reliability but do not match anything in the builtin dictionary
medical_487.txt$yellow shade which are words that wordscan plus doesnt think it converted
medical_487.txt$correctly at all  i have found that the software should give itself more
medical_487.txt$credit  it is usually correct instead of wrong  if a word is shaded blue
medical_487.txt$you can add it to your personal dictionary  the only problem is the personal
medical_487.txt$dictionary will only handle about 200 words  i find this to be very limited
medical_487.txt$considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary
medical_487.txt$after a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word
medical_487.txt$processor formats  also any images that were captured can be stored in a
medical_487.txt$seperate tiff or pcx file format
medical_487.txt$i was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files  i use
