historical_89.txt$considering factors such as globalization and military advancement professor david stevenson examines the political and diplomatic landscape of europe before the outbreak of world war one
historical_89.txt$europe in the early 20th century had known no great war involving all the continents major powers since the fall of napoleon although european society had been transformed in the interim the changes had made war more difficult rather than impossible and the underpinnings of the long 19thcentury peace had grown fragile
historical_89.txt$globalization
historical_89.txt$characteristic of the pre1914 decades was what we would now call globalization trade may have risen from one thirtieth to one third of world production between 1800 and 1913 between 1855 and 1914 investment flows grew 20 times europe accounted for nearly two thirds of global trade and even more of global investment and from the 1890s europes major currencies were fixed in value in relation to each other under the international gold standard hundreds of thousands of foreignborn labourers worked in the heavy industries of french lorraine and germanys ruhr the british writer norman angell in his 1909 bestseller europes optical illusion maintained that war between advanced modern economies was now irrational1 yet british naval planners saw economic interdependence as making germany more vulnerable and the german general staff considered war remained a viable option at least if victory came quickly

historical_89.txt$democratization
historical_89.txt$a second 19thcentury characteristic was democratization by 1914 all the european powers had elected lower houses of parliament and a majority of the adult male population was enfranchised the press was relatively free and citizens could form parties and pressure groups nonetheless in austriahungary germany and russia ministers answered to monarchs rather than to a parliamentary majority and the military chiefs were not subordinate to civilian statesmen moreover as international tension mounted public opinion polarized more moderate and progressive tendencies being offset by nationalism and militarism europes socialist parties opposed wars of conquest and aggression but were willing to endorse a war fought for just cause and in selfdefence which in 1914 all the governments would claim to be fighting

historical_89.txt$military revolutions
historical_89.txt$the 19th century had also witnessed a succession of military revolutions at sea steel had superseded wooden hulls and steam had superseded sail hms dreadnought launched by britain in 1906 with turbine engines and 10 12inch guns made all existing battleships obsolete on land prussias combination of universal liability to conscription forward strategic planning by a general staff and railwayborne mobilization helped win the wars of german unification and was widely emulated breechloading cannon with rifled steel barrels replaced smoothbore muzzleloaders and infantry rifles replaced muskets smokeless high explosive replaced powder in bullets and shells and the modern field gun fired up to 20 rounds per minute yet although on balance these developments favoured defenders over attackers military planners concluded from the 190405 russojapanese war that offensive tactics could still prevail albeit at much higher cost than before

historical_89.txt$international organization
historical_89.txt$war therefore remained possible and the leading international political institution the concert of europe was too weak to prevent it the concert was not a permanent fixture but rather an understanding that at times of crisis the powers would try to resolve their differences peacefully through a conference of ambassadors it was a valuable facesaving device if governments wished to use it but in 1914 when britain proposed a conference germany encouraged austriahungary to refuse
historical_89.txt$
historical_89.txt$a balance of power
historical_89.txt$peace therefore depended on more traditional devices such as the balance of power and deterrence in the 1870s and 1880s the newly unified german second empire under the chancellorship of otto von bismarck was not only the strongest continental military power but also spun a web of alliances that left france  resentful of its defeat in 1870  isolated the austrogerman alliance of 1879 developed into the triple alliance including italy in 1882 and russia too concluded agreements with the germanled bloc but after wilhelm ii became emperor he allowed the connection with russia to lapse facilitating the formation in 189194 of a francorussian alliance even so for a time the two groupings balanced each other and russia and france were in rivalry not only with germany but also in central asia and in africa with britain so secure did germany still feel that from 1898 it too challenged britain through a major programme of north sea battleship building

historical_89.txt$the beginning of the 20th century
historical_89.txt$after 190407 the lineup became more ominous russia was weakened for several years after its defeat by japan germany tried but failed to form a germanfrancorussian bloc excluding britain instead the british compromised over their extraeuropean disputes with the french in the entente cordiale of 1904 and over those with the russians in 1907 and began cooperating diplomatically with their former adversaries in 1902 italy had reached a separate understanding with france germanys leaders protested that the triple entente encircled them while their one remaining reliable ally austriahungary was a multinational empire that was hobbled by interethnic disputes and menaced by a growing confrontation with its neighbour serbia which with russian encouragement fomented separatism among austriahungarys south slavs after 1905 europe experienced a succession of diplomatic crises that heightened antagonism between the two blocs from 1912 the anglogerman naval race lost impetus as a land arms race between the austrogerman and francorussian alliances superseded it in retrospect it is easy to discern the warning signs but at the time they were less evident and as late as spring 1914 tensions seemed to be easing the french socialist leader jean jaur√®s believed the peaceful resolution of so many crises had bred a dangerous complacency nonetheless a general war was not inevitable until deliberate decisions created it
