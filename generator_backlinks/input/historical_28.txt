historical_28.txt$january 22 1879  the battle of rorkes drift took place in south africa on this day and is remembered as one of the worlds most remarkable military engagements it was to be commemorated in 1964 with the release of the film zulu giving michael caine his first major screen role
historical_28.txt$
historical_28.txt$britain was intent on expanding its territory and influence in south africa in the 1870s and had declared war on the kingdom of zululand rorkes drift was a mission station near the border between the british colony of natal and the zulu kingdom and had been occupied by british troops when the battle began though only 139 soldiers were encamped there they had no idea what lay in store
historical_28.txt$
historical_28.txt$at 420pm on january 22 1879 a force of 4000 zulu warriors began to lay siege to the station their intermittent attacks were to last for almost twelve hours
historical_28.txt$
historical_28.txt$fortunately for the british although some of the zulus had old muskets and antiquated rifles most were armed only with a short spear called an assegai and a shield made of cowhide so in weaponry they were no match for the highly trained soldiers with their then sophisticated rifles and firepower but the manpower advantage lay massively in favour of the zulus
historical_28.txt$
historical_28.txt$by 4am after nearly 12 hours repulsing wave after wave of attacks involving handtohand combat a number of british soldiers lay dead most of the others were exhausted rapidly running out of ammunition and probably in no condition to repel another assault but they didnt have to as dawn broke they saw that the zulus were gone leaving behind a battleground littered with the dead and dying zulu casualties were around 500 while the british sustained 17 dead and 10 wounded
