politics_34.txt$tories attack burglar uturns
politics_34.txt$tory leader michael howard has accused tony blair of performing uturns over rules on using force against burglars
politics_34.txt$the government has ruled out amending the present law which allows reasonable force in self defence mr howard branded the decision unacceptable saying it is not householders who should be frightened its the burglars home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law
politics_34.txt$metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using grossly disproportionate force could be prosecuted the pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and crown prosecution service would be consulted as part of a review of the law he told mps if we get the right response from those people we will of course support a change in the law instead the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves on thursday mr howard told bbc radio 4s today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again he said weve had three policy positions in three months and two uturns its not surprising gordon brown told him theres nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe
politics_34.txt$mr howard said the grossly disproportionate test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16yearold burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were weighted overwhelmingly in favour of the householder said mr clarke he said the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it  that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue added mr clarke the director of public prosecutions ken macdonald says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar tied him up beat him and set him alight he said tory mp patrick mercers private members bill to change the law received a first reading in parliament on wednesday and goes to a full debate next month
