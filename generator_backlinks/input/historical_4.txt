historical_4.txt$archaeobotanists at ucl helped mott and a team of collaborators choose a handful of wellpreserved husks from the museums collection of ancient emmer wheat a variety native to the near east and one of the first crops to be domesticated in the region from which the researchers selected two husks for dna extraction after carefully removing the husks from the box photographing them and wrapping them in foil the scientists transported the centuriesold plant material to a freshly bleached cleanroom used exclusively to process ancient and forensic samples 
historical_4.txt$there team member laura botigué a population geneticist and visiting researcher from the centre for research in agricultural genomics crag in barcelona spain donned a hairnet two tyvek suits two pairs of latex gloves and a maskpart of a protocol designed to avoid contaminating the samples with her own cells uncertain how the delicate husks would hold up to the standard decontamination protocol of bleaching the samples botigué bleached one and left the second untouched then to lyse the plants cells she put the samples in a rotator that gently shook the husks inside an oven over the next several days finally she used a centrifugation protocol to separate any dna from the degraded cell walls and proteins
historical_4.txt$
historical_4.txt$once the samples had been prepped and delivered to the ucl genomics facility for sequencing it was a waiting game to see if the procedure had yielded any readable wheat dna this is the more stressful part botigué says because they lack the type of protective collagen matrix found in bones plants dont preserve ancient dna as well as animals you finish the dna is theoretically extracted but you dont see it in the tube says botigué youre in the blind until you hear back from the sequencing services 
historical_4.txt$
historical_4.txt$within just a few weeks the team got good news for the husk that botigué had bleached about twothirds of the reads aligned with genomes of modern wild and domesticated emmer wheat varietiesa relatively good success rate for ancient dna according to evolutionary geneticist michael scott a postdoc in motts lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences the first surprise was how well it worked he says it appears that the dry conditions in egypt were good for dna preservation the unbleached husk had yielded a smaller quantity of sequences but those fragments mostly matched the ones in the bleached sample validating the identity of those sequences as coming from the ancient wheat samples rather than from contaminants
historical_4.txt$the museum wheat which carbon dating showed was from between 1130 and 1000 bc was genetically much more similar to modern domesticated varieties than to modern wild ones suggesting that the plant lineage the samples came from had already been domesticated specifically the sequences most resembled those of modern domesticated strains grown in turkey oman and india there was also evidence for genetic exchange between the museum wheat strain and the wild emmer wheat that grew in the levant a large region in the eastern mediterranean that was a center of agricultural development in the neolithic period and where emmer was first cultivated the genetic exchange could have occurred before the wheats introduction to egypt from the levant says scott alternatively its possible that the ancient egyptians wheat was able to interbreed with wild wheat in the southern levant thanks to interactions between the people in the two regions 
historical_4.txt$with big data and with a really good analysis method they were able to detect this gene flow says m timothy rabanuswallace an agricultural geneticist at the leibniz institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in germany who coauthored a perspective published alongside the study in nature plants last october its fascinating to see this gene flow happening    in an area important for human history

historical_4.txt$the bioinformatics analysis also uncovered some genetic variants in the ancient samples that werent found in any of the modern emmer wheat genomes the researchers studied if these variants helped the wheat survive in arid locations around the near east perhaps introducing those sequences into modern varieties could help make them more sustainable or more drought resistant scott says though he admits that this is very much just an idea 
historical_4.txt$the detection of ancient genetic variation is a notable achievement because wheat genomes are largethree to five times the length of a human genomeand repetitive making the analysis    incredibly complex says james breen head of the bioinformatics core at the south australian health and medical research institute who reviewed the study and coauthored the perspective with rabanuswallace a phd student in his lab at the australian centre for ancient dna at the time so being able to find unique pieces of dna in that genome is very difficult he adds that after a couple of additional validation tests performed by the ucl team he was convinced that the data that came out was legitimately ancient
historical_4.txt$
historical_4.txt$botigué and scott emphasize that the study is primarily a proof of concept that museumkept plant samples can yield readable genetic material we were able to look at dna from specimens that had been stored in the museum for over 90 years without special preservation conditionsthe museum was actually even bombed and flooded during wartime says scott we think our study helps demonstrate the importance of museum collections as sources of genetic data whichin combination with new samplescan be used to uncover the history of selection on crops and their movement around the globe
