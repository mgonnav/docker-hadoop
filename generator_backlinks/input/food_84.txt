food_84.txt$naturally there are some caveats the first is that our understanding of phthalates is still evolving so its possible that the acceptable threshold may decrease as we learn more and its true that the important thing may not be how much were exposed to but when were exposed to it an adult who has fully developed is likely less sensitive to the effects of phthalates than a fetus or an infant whose development can be fundamentally changed by hormonal disruptions
food_84.txt$
food_84.txt$the united states environmental protection agency epa already sets a much lower threshold for the level of phthalates an infant should consumejust 02 milligrams a day per kilogram of body weight if your average fourmonthold infant scarfed down an entire box of the powdered stuff he or she could indeed exceed that limit but if your fourmonthold has jumped right from their first taste of solid food to consuming an entire box of macncheese a day you probably have other concerns your typical twoyearolda demographic with more cause for concernwould have to eat five boxes to exceed the epas safe dosage toddlers may love their powdered cheese but are they regularly eating thousands of calories worth in a single day again were concerned and its not because of your tykes phthalate exposure
food_84.txt$
food_84.txt$the real issue is that these chemicals are ubiquitous so macncheese is likely not your only source of exposure if you wear perfume wash your clothes with detergents containing fragrance breathe while inside a room with vinyl floors eat a container of jelly or chow down on a carton of vegan ice cream youre probably getting some phthalates too
