politics_117.txt$i think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the lords and the commons lord falconer told bbc1s breakfast with frost how it interacts with the commons is a very very important issue we need to address the issue in the manifesto but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes the lord chancellor currently has the role of house of lords speaker he is also head of the judiciary and a member of the cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary
