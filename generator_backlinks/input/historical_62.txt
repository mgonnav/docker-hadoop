historical_62.txt$de gaulle convoked the first referendum on the selfdetermination of algeria on 8 january 1961 which 75 of the voters both in france and algeria approved and de gaulles government began secret peace negotiations with the fln in the algerian départements 6951 voted in favor of selfdetermination73 the talks that began in march 1961 broke down when de gaulle insisted on including the much smaller mouvement national algérien mna which the fln objected to74 since the fln was the by far stronger movement with the mna almost wiped out by this time the french were finally forced to exclude the mna from the talks after the fln walked out for a time7488
historical_62.txt$
historical_62.txt$the generals putsch in april 1961 aimed at canceling the governments negotiations with the fln marked the turning point in the official attitude toward the algerian war leading the coup attempt to depose de gaulle were general raoul salan general andré zeller general maurice challe and general edmond jouhaud748797 only the paratroop divisions and the foreign legion joined the coup while the air force navy and most of the army stayed loyal to general de gaulle but at one moment de gaulle went on french television to ask for public support with the normally lofty de gaulle saying frenchmen frenchwomen help me7489 de gaulle was now prepared to abandon the piedsnoirs which no previous french government was willing to do the army had been discredited by the putsch and kept a low profile politically throughout the rest of frances involvement with algeria the oas was to be the main standard bearer for the piedsnoirs for the rest of the war
historical_62.txt$talks with the fln reopened at évian in may 1961 after several false starts the french government decreed that a ceasefire would take effect on march 18 1962 a major difficulty at the talks was de gaulles decision to grant independence only to the coastal regions of algeria where the bulk of the population lived while hanging onto the sahara which happened to be rich in oil and gas while the fln claimed all of algeria74 during the talks the piednoir and muslim communities engaged in a low level civil war with bombings shootings throatcutting and assassinations being the preferred methods7490 the canadian historian john cairns wrote at times it seemed like both communities were going berserk as everyday murder was indiscriminate7490 on 29 june 1961 de gaulle announced on tv that fighting was virtually finished and afterwards there was no major fighting between the french army and the fln during the summer of 1961 the oas and the fln engaged in a civil war in which the greater number of the muslims soon made a difference7490 to pressure de gaulle to abandon his demand to keep the sahara the fln organized demonstrations in france from algerians living there in the fall of 1961 which the french police crushed7491 it was in the course of crushing one demonstration that a massacre of algerians on 17 october 1961 which was ordered by maurice papon took place on 10 january 1962 the fln started a general offensive against the oas staging a series on the piednoir communities as a way of applying pressure7491 on 7 february 1962 the oas attempted to assassinate the culture minister andré malraux by setting off a bomb in his apartment building that failed to kill its intended target but did leave a fouryear girl living in the adjoining apartment blinded by the shrapnel75 the blinding of the girl did much to turn french opinion against the oas
historical_62.txt$
historical_62.txt$on 20 february 1962 a peace accord was reached for granting independence to all of algeria7487 in their final form the évian accords allowed the piedsnoirs equal legal protection with algerians over a threeyear period these rights included respect for property participation in public affairs and a full range of civil and cultural rights at the end of that period however all algerian residents would be obliged to become algerian citizens or be classified as aliens with the attendant loss of rights the agreement also allowed france to establish military bases in algeria even after independence including the nuclear test site of regghane the naval base of merselkebir and the air base of bou sfer and to have privileges visàvis algerian oil the oas started a campaign of spectacular terrorist attacks to sabotage the évian accords hoping that if enough muslims were killed a general pogrom against the piedsnoirs would break out leading the french army to turn its guns against the government7487 despite ample provocation with oas lobbing mortar shells into the casbah of algiers the fln gave orders for no retaliatory attacks7487 in the spring of 1962 the oas turned to bank robbery to finance its war against both the fln and the french state and bombed special units sent by paris to hunt them down7493 only eighty deputies voted against the évian accords in the national assembly and cairns wrote the fulminations of jeanmarie le pen against de gaulle were only the traditional verbal excesses of thirdrate firebrands without a substantial following and without a constructive idea74
historical_62.txt$
historical_62.txt$following the cease fire tensions developed between the piednoir community and their former protectors in the french army an oas ambush of french conscripts on 20 march was followed by 20000 gendarmes and troops being ordered to occupy the major piednoir district of babeloued in algiers16524 a week later frenchofficered muslim tirailleurs panicked and opened fire on a crowd of piednoir demonstrators in the centre of the city76 total casualties in these three incidents were 326 dead and wounded amongst the piednoir and 110 french military personnel165245 a journalist who saw the shootings on 26 march 1962 henry tanner described the scene when the shooting stopped the street was littered with bodies of women as well as men dead wounded or dying the black pavement looked grey as if bleached by fire crumpled french flags were lying in pools of blood shattered glass and spent cartridges were everywhere7494 a number of shocked piedsnoirs screamed that they were not french anymore7495 one woman screamed stop firing my god were french before she was shot down7495 the massacre served to greatly embitter the piednoir community and led to a massive surge of support for the oas7495
historical_62.txt$
historical_62.txt$in the second referendum on the independence of algeria held in april 1962 91 percent of the french electorate approved the evian accords on 1 july 1962 some 6 million of a total algerian electorate of 65 million cast their ballots the vote was nearly unanimous with 5992115 votes for independence 16534 against with most piedsnoirs and harkis either having fled or abstaining77 de gaulle pronounced algeria an independent country on 3 july the provisional executive however proclaimed 5 july the 132nd anniversary of the french entry into algeria as the day of national independence
historical_62.txt$
historical_62.txt$during the three months between the ceasefire and the french referendum on algeria the oas unleashed a new campaign the oas sought to provoke a major breach in the ceasefire by the fln but the attacks now were aimed also against the french army and police enforcing the accords as well as against muslims it was the most wanton carnage that algeria had witnessed in eight years of savage warfare oas operatives set off an average of 120 bombs per day in march with targets including hospitals and schools
historical_62.txt$
historical_62.txt$during the summer of 1962 a rush of piedsnoirs fled to france within a year 14 million refugees including almost the entire jewish community had joined the exodus despite the declaration of independence on 5 july 1962 the last french forces did not leave the naval base of mers el kébir until 1967 the evian accords had permitted france to maintain its military presence for fifteen years so the withdrawal in 1967 was significantly ahead of schedule16 cairns writing from paris in 1962 declared in some ways the last year has been the worse tension has never been higher disenchantment in france at least has never been greater the mindless cruelty of it all has never been more absurd and savage this last year stretching from the hopeful spring of 1961 to the ceasefire of 18 march 1962 spanned a season of shadow boxing false threats capitulation and murderous hysteria french algeria died badly its agony was marked by panic and brutality as ugly as the record of european imperialism could show in the spring of 1962 the unhappy corpse of empire still shuddered and lashed out and stained itself in fratricide the whole episode of its death measured at least seven and half years constituted perhaps the most pathetic and sordid event in the entire history of colonialism it is hard to see how anybody of importance in the tangled web of the conflict came out looking well nobody won the conflict nobody dominated it7487
