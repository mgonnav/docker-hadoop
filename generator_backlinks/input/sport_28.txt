sport_28.txt$darren campbell has set his sights on running quicker than ever after deciding not to retire from sprinting
sport_28.txt$campbell who won olympic 4x100m relay gold had been unsure about his future but he told five lives sportsweek i had to get back into training before i could decide because if i didnt have the same hunger id have to walk away ive started back and im thoroughly enjoying it im looking forward to it ive got to run under 10 seconds for 100m and under 20 seconds for 200m campbell was part of the british quartet who shocked the americans to win relay gold in athens in august
sport_28.txt$the newportbased athlete and teammates jason gardener marlon devonish and mark lewisfrancis were rewarded with mbes in the new year honours list campbells relay triumph made up for his disappointing displays in the individual 100m and 200m events in athens when he failed to reach the finals the 31yearold who won olympic 200m silver in sydney in 2000 said during the games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best
sport_28.txt$he was criticised at the time by former olympic champion michael johnson who cast doubt on campbells injury claims to go to athens and finally get the gold ive been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief said campbell it was a chance for me to prove that if id been fit i would have been challenging for the individual medals every season i go and challenge for the medals so why would last season have been any different its just unfortunate that i picked up that injury just before the olympics campbell set his 100m personal best of 1004secs when he won the european title in budapest in 1998 and he ran 2013secs in the quarterfinals of the 200m in sydney on the way to olympic silver
