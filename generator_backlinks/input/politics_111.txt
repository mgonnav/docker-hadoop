politics_111.txt$kilroy launches veritas party
politics_111.txt$exbbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroysilk has said he wants to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party
politics_111.txt$mr kilroysilk who recently quit the uk independence partysaid our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration he told a london news conference that veritas  latin for truth  would avoid the old parties lies and spin ukip leader roger knapman says he was glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk
politics_111.txt$mr kilroysilk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks and he announced the party would be holding a leadership election on thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election  that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoons ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukips two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukips chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left
politics_111.txt$mr kilroysilk announced his decision to quit ukip at a public meeting in hinckley leicestershire last week it came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last junes european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said i will be standing at the next general election i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight
politics_111.txt$mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroysilk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroysilk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroysilk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead
politics_111.txt$this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further
politics_111.txt$thank goodness that kilroysilk has gone  now ukip at least has a chance in the election
politics_111.txt$it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroysilk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroysilk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in infighting
politics_111.txt$ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroysilk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroysilk
politics_111.txt$if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a byelections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another
politics_111.txt$so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow
politics_111.txt$interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name
politics_111.txt$every opinion poll points to an overwhelming antieurope feeling in this country kilroysilk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroysilk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come
politics_111.txt$well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party its all flash and no real policy here
politics_111.txt$lets hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroysilk slipping into obscurity
politics_111.txt$veritas the name will doom it but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the tootwee label of veritas symbolises that
