politics_20.txt$concerns at school diploma plan
politics_20.txt$final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for englands secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report
politics_20.txt$the governments response to the plan for a fourtier diploma to replace all existing 1419 qualifications is expected next week some are worried it could be scuppered if as tony blair and ruth kelly have suggested gcses and alevels stay sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a halfhearted response said the chairman of the commons education select committee labour mp barry sheerman
politics_20.txt$his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma  but only to replace existing vocational qualifications we must tackle headon the structural mess that is our secondary education system he wrote in the times educational supplement it is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak the qualifications and curriculum authority qca has also told the government not to compromise the qca said the potential stepchange in participation and attainment lay in the integrity of the whole diploma any partial implementation of the proposals would in our view compromise that integrity said its chairman sir anthony greener it is a sign of the qcas concern that its advice went to ministers last december but was publicised only recently but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills they may be content if it does not close too many doors in writing  whatever spin is put on it
politics_20.txt$the chief inspector of schools david bell also said recently that gcses and alevels should go one of the reasons why im so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that its good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system he said if we dont say this is a seachange in education we will miss a great opportunity universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students a note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers organisation the cbi which complains of a lack of skills in an attempt to address this the tomlinson plan is for tests in functional maths and literacy  decidedly not gcses it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms concerns on this score another dissenter is sir mike tomlinsons predecessor as chief schools inspector professor chris woodhead who has said there is no need for such a massive upheaval the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top alevel grade no matter how well the others have done
