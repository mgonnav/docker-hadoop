medical_334.txt$mississippi  my journey partners want to live off of river water and
medical_334.txt$catfish along the route  should i have any concerns about pollution or
medical_334.txt$health risks in doing this
medical_334.txt$youd have to purify the river water first  im not sure how practical
medical_334.txt$that is with the mississippi  youd better check with health agencies
medical_334.txt$along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river  if
medical_334.txt$it is just microorganisms those can be filtered or killed but you
medical_334.txt$may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals
medical_334.txt$better be same than sorry  obviously drinking the river without
medical_334.txt$processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites
