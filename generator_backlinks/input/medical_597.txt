medical_597.txt$poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did
medical_597.txt$not exist  calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i
medical_597.txt$see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well
medical_597.txt$do you believe that any quacks exist  how about quack diagnoses  is
medical_597.txt$being a licensed physician enough to guarantee that someone is not
medical_597.txt$a quack or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack
medical_597.txt$other people shouldnt say so  can you give an example of a
medical_597.txt$commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis
medical_597.txt$or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer
medical_597.txt$need to worry about unscrupulous healers taking advantage of
medical_597.txt$people
medical_597.txt$david rind
medical_597.txt$sure there are quacks there are quacks who dont treat and quacks who
medical_597.txt$treat ones that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly
medical_597.txt$there are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks smart quacks and dumb ones
medical_597.txt$there are people ahead of their time with unprobable or unproven theories
medical_597.txt$and rationals there are illreasoned absurd theorists
medical_597.txt$sometimes its hard to tell whos who
medical_597.txt$reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors
medical_597.txt$quacks in babylon
medical_597.txt$arguments abound when there arent any firm answers plenty of illnesses
medical_597.txt$arent or cant be diagnosed or treated but i think its better to argue
medical_597.txt$against the theory as was originally done with postings on candida a month
medical_597.txt$or so ago stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an
medical_597.txt$opinion about someones competency and you cant convince everybody
medical_597.txt$sometimes a correct diagnosis
medical_597.txt$takes years for people they dont run into a doctor who recognizes the
medical_597.txt$disease they havent developed something recognizable yet or they have
medical_597.txt$something that no one is going to recognize because it hasnt been
medical_597.txt$described yet sometimes they get a cure sometimes the illness wears out
medical_597.txt$sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment
medical_597.txt$sometimes they find its incurable
medical_597.txt$there is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an
medical_597.txt$illness unless its a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease its is
medical_597.txt$more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking
