politics_231.txt$woolf murder sentence rethink
politics_231.txt$plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down
politics_231.txt$there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council  led by lord woolf  published its proposals for england and wales it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity but that has now been changed to onesixth with no reduction for those killers given a whole life tariff at the time lord woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances  for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and cooperation he said
politics_231.txt$but director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the lawabiding public the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council sgc the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said
politics_231.txt$in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines i am confident as a result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process it represents a tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said
