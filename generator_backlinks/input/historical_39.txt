historical_39.txt$the british occupation of basra turkeys port at the head of the persian gulf in november 1914 had been justifiable strategically because of the need to protect the oil wells of southern persia and the abadan refinery the british advance of 46 miles northward from basra to alqurnah in december and the further advance of 90 miles up the tigris to alʿamārah in mayjune 1915 ought to have been reckoned enough for all practical purposes but the advance was continued in the direction of the fatally magnetic baghdad ancient capital of the arab caliphs of islām alkūt was occupied in september 1915 and the advance was pushed on until the british under major general charles townshend were 500 miles away from their base at basra they fought a profitless battle at ctesiphon only 18 miles from baghdad on november 22 but then had to retreat to alkūt there from december 7 townshends 10000 men were besieged by the turks and there on april 29 1916 they surrendered themselves into captivity
