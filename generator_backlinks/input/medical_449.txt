medical_449.txt$am i justified in being pissed off at this doctor
medical_449.txt$last saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife
medical_449.txt$i took him to a local urgent and general care clinic at 550 pm  the
medical_449.txt$clinic was open till 600 pm  the receptionist went to the back and told the
medical_449.txt$doctor that we were there and came back and told us the doctor would not
medical_449.txt$see us because she had someplace to go at 600 and did not want to be delayed
medical_449.txt$here  during the next few minutes in response to my questions with several
medical_449.txt$trips to the back room the receptionist told me
medical_449.txt$ the doctor was doing paperwork in the back
medical_449.txt$ the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going
medical_449.txt$to the emergency room
medical_449.txt$ the doctor would not even speak to me
medical_449.txt$ she would not tell me the doctors name or her own name
medical_449.txt$ when asked who is in charge of the clinic she said i dont know
medical_449.txt$i realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room but
medical_449.txt$i was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to
medical_449.txt$be bothered  my son did get three stitches at the emergency room  im still
medical_449.txt$trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so i can write them a
medical_449.txt$letter   we will certainly never set foot in that clinic again
