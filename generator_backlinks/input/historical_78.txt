historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$the country was also occupied by other powers  the persians nubians greeks and romans all conquered the country at different points in time 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$a number of names were used for egypt in ancient times a popular ancient name for egypt was kemet which means the black land scholars generally believe that this name derives from the fertile soil that is left over when the nile flood recedes in august 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$the flooding of the nile occurred between june and august and the fertile soil it created was vital to ancient egypts survival with fertility playing an important role in egyptian religion the burial of tutankhamun  in which his penis was mummified erect  is but one example of how important fertility was in the rituals and beliefs of the ancient egyptians  
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$the countrys ancient rulers are referred to today as pharaohs although in ancient times they each used a series of names as part of a royal titular wrote ronald leprohon an egyptology professor at the university of toronto in his book the great name ancient egyptian royal titulary society of biblical literature 2013 the word pharaoh actually originates from the term peraa which means the great house leprohon wrote the term was first incorporated into a royal titulary during the rule of thutmose iii reign ca 14791425 bc wrote leprohon

historical_78.txt$prehistory
historical_78.txt$when exactly early hominids first arrived in egypt is unclear the earliest migration of hominids out of africa took place almost 2 million years ago with modern humans dispersing out of africa about 100000 years ago egypt may have been used to reach asia in some of these migrations 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$villages dependent on agriculture began to appear in egypt about 7000 years ago and the civilizations earliest written inscriptions date back about 5200 years they discuss the early rulers of egypt these early rulers include iryhor who according to recently discovered inscriptions founded memphis a city that served as egypts capital for much of its history when and how egypt was united is unclear and is a matter of debate among archaeologists and historians  
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$egypts climate was much wetter in prehistoric times than it is today this means that some areas that are now barren desert were fertile one famous archaeological site where this can be seen is at the cave of swimmers as it is called today on the gilf kebir plateau in southwest egypt the cave is now surrounded by miles of barren desert however it has rock art showing what some scholars interpret as people swimming the exact date of the rock art is unclear although scholars think that it was created in prehistoric times  
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$egypts 30 dynasties
historical_78.txt$egypts history has traditionally been divided into 30 sometimes 31 dynasties this tradition started with the egyptian priest manetho who lived during the third century bc his accounts of ancient egyptian history were preserved by ancient greek writers and until the deciphering of hieroglyphic writing in the 19th century were one of the few historical accounts that scholars could read 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$modernday scholars often group these dynasties into several periods dynasties one and two date back around 5000 years and are often called the early dynastic or archaic period the first pharaoh of the first dynasty was a ruler named menes or narmer as he is called in greek he lived over 5000 years ago and while ancient writers sometimes credited him as being the first pharaoh of a united egypt we know today that this is not true  there was a group of egyptian rulers that predated menes scholars sometimes refer to these premenes rulers as being part of a dynasty zero 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$dynasties 36 date from roughly 26502150 bc and are often lumped into a time period called the old kingdom by modernday scholars during this time pyramid building techniques were developed and the pyramids of giza were built 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$from 21502030 bc a time period that encompassed dynasties 710 and part of the 11 the central government in egypt was weak and the country was often controlled by different regional leaders why the old kingdom collapsed is a matter of debate among scholars with recent research indicating that drought and climate change played a significant role during this time other cities and civilizations in the middle east also collapsed with evidence at archaeological sites indicating that a period of drought and arid climate hit sites across the middle east 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$dynasties 12 13 as well as part of the 11th are often called the middle kingdom by scholars and lasted from ca 20301640 bc at the start of this dynasty a ruler named mentuhotep ii who reigned until about 2000 bc reunited egypt into a single country pyramid building resumed in egypt and a sizable number of texts documenting the civilizations literature and science were recorded among the surviving texts is the edwin smith surgical papyrus which includes a variety of medical treatments that modernday medical doctors have hailed as being advanced for their time 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$dynasties 1417 are often lumped into the second intermediate period by modernday scholars during this time central government again collapsed in egypt with part of the country being occupied by the hyksos a group from the levant an area that encompasses modernday israel palestine lebanon jordan and syria one gruesome find from this time period is a series of severed hands cut off from their human victims which were found at a palace at the city of avaris the capital of hyksoscontrolled egypt the cutoff hands may have been presented by soldiers to a ruler in exchange for gold 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$scholars often refer to dynasties 1820 as encompassing the new kingdom a period that lasted ca 15501070 bc this time period takes place after the hyksos had been driven out of egypt by a series of egyptian rulers and the country was reunited perhaps the most famous archaeological site from this time period is the valley of the kings which holds the burial sites of many egyptian rulers from this time period including that of tutankhamun reign ca 13361327 bc whose rich tomb was found intact photos more than 40 tombs discovered in upper egypt 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$dynasties 2124 a period from ca 1070713 bc are often called the third intermediate period by modernday scholars the central government was sometimes weak during this time period and the country was not always united during this time cities and civilizations across the middle east had been destroyed by a wave of people from the aegean whom modernday scholars sometimes call the sea peoples while egyptian rulers claimed to have defeated the sea peoples in battle it didnt prevent egyptian civilization from also collapsing the loss of trade routes and revenue may have played a role in the weakening of egypts central government 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$dynasties 2531 date ca 712332 bc are often referred to as the late period by scholars egypt was sometimes under the control of foreign powers during this period the rulers of the 25th dynasty were from nubia an area now located in southern egypt and northern sudan the persians and assyrians also controlled egypt at different times during the late period 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$in 332 bc alexander the great drove the persians out of egypt and incorporated the country into the macedonian empire after alexander the greats death a line of rulers descended from ptolemy soter one of alexanders generals the last of these ptolemaic rulers as scholars often call them was cleopatra vii who committed suicide in 30 bc after the defeat of her forces by the roman emperor augustus at the battle of actium after her death egypt was incorporated into the roman empire 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$although the roman emperors were based in rome the egyptians treated them as pharaohs one recently excavated carving shows the emperor claudius reign ad 4154 dressed as a pharaoh the carving has hieroglyphic inscriptions that say that claudius is the son of ra lord of the crowns and is king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$neither the ptolemaic or roman rulers are considered to be part of a numbered dynasty 
historical_78.txt$religion
historical_78.txt$throughout much of egypts ancient history its people followed a polytheistic religion in which a vast number of gods and goddesses were venerated one of the most important was osiris god of the underworld abydos was an important cult center for him and numerous temples and shrines were constructed at the site in his honor 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$navigating the underworld was vital to the ancient egyptians who believed that the dead could reach a paradise of sorts where they could live forever egyptian dead were sometimes mummified preserving the body and were sometimes buried with spells that aided them in navigating the underworld 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$in ancient egyptian mythology one of the first steps in navigating the underworld was to weigh a persons deeds against the feather of maat if the person had committed a great deal of wrongdoing the persons heart would be heavier than the feather and the persons soul would be obliterated on the other hand if their deeds were generally good they passed forward and had the opportunity to successfully navigate the underworld  
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$figurines called shabti were often buried with the deceased  their purpose being to do the work of the deceased in the afterlife for them 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$egyptian religion did not remain static but changed over time one major change occurred during the reign of the pharaoh akhenaten ca 13531335 bc a ruler who unleashed a religious revolution that saw egyptian religion become focused around the worship of the aten the sun disk he built an entirely new capital in the desert at amarna and ordered the names of some of egypts deities to be defaced after akhenatens death his son tutankhamun denounced him and returned egypt to its previous polytheistic religion 
historical_78.txt$
historical_78.txt$when egypt came under greek and roman rule their gods and goddesses were incorporated into egyptian religion another major change occurred after the first century ad when christianity spread throughout egypt at this time gnosticism a religion that incorporated some christian beliefs also spread throughout egypt and a large corpus of gnostic texts were discovered in 1945 in southern egypt near the city of nag hammadi
