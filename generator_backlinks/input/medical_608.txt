medical_608.txt$do you believe that any quacks exist  how about quack diagnoses  is
medical_608.txt$true focus of the medical profession  the ama and the boards should focus
medical_608.txt$on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on searchand
medical_608.txt$destroymissions to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non
medical_608.txt$traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients
medical_608.txt$that traditionalaccepted medicine cannot help
medical_608.txt$if i prescribe itraconazole for a patients sinusitis neither the ama
medical_608.txt$fda state licensing board nor abfp will be knocking on my door to ask
medical_608.txt$why  this is a specious argument
medical_608.txt$on their backs and peepee on themselves in obedience  what do they teach
medical_608.txt$you in medical school  how to throw your authority around
medical_608.txt$among other things how to evaluate new theories and treatments
medical_608.txt$let me put it another way to make my point clear  quack is a nebulous word
medical_608.txt$lacking in any precision  its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand
medical_608.txt$funny i thought it meant one who fraudulently misrepresents his
medical_608.txt$ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or
medical_608.txt$the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers dorlands
medical_608.txt$27th  certainly more precision than conveyed by chronic yeast
medical_608.txt$the indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency  and coming
medical_608.txt$from any medical doctor or wannabe where competency is expected is real
medical_608.txt$scary
medical_608.txt$the inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous
medical_608.txt$representations is far more frightening  it is fraud to promote a
medical_608.txt$treatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it
medical_608.txt$and the quacksalver knows so or error if the honest practitioner
medical_608.txt$doesnt know so  failure to speak out against either bespeaks
medical_608.txt$incompetency
medical_608.txt$ps may i suggest  seriously  that if the doctors and wannabedoctors on
medical_608.txt$the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
medical_608.txt$theories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated group
medical_608.txt$may i reply  seriously  that if the practitioners and proponents of
medical_608.txt$nonscientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts
medical_608.txt$of their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out they should
medical_608.txt$learn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing
medical_608.txt$hierarchy and divisions
