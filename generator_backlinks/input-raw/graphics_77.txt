graphics_77.txt$i have posted a dos mpeg decoderplayer to altbinariespicturesutilities
graphics_77.txt$here is a short description and some technical information taken from the
graphics_77.txt$accompanying documentation
graphics_77.txt$public domain mpeg decoder
graphics_77.txt$by stefan eckart
graphics_77.txt$0 features
graphics_77.txt$dmpegdmplay is another mpeg decoderplayer for the pc
graphics_77.txt$ decodes nearly the full mpeg video standard
graphics_77.txt$ipb frames frame size up to at least 352x240 supported
graphics_77.txt$ saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display
graphics_77.txt$ optional onscreen display during decoding requires vga
graphics_77.txt$ several dithering options ordered dither floydsteinberg grayscale
graphics_77.txt$ colorspace selection
graphics_77.txt$ runs under dos 640kb ram no mswindows required
graphics_77.txt$ very compact small code  small data models 16 bit arithmetic
graphics_77.txt$ real time display of the raw file by a separate player for
graphics_77.txt$vga and many supervgas
graphics_77.txt$4 technical information
graphics_77.txt$the player is a rather straightforward implementation of the mpeg spec 1
graphics_77.txt$the idct is based on the chenwang 13 multiplication algorithm 2
graphics_77.txt$not quite the optimum i know blocks with not more than eight nonzero
graphics_77.txt$coefficients use a nonseparated direct multiplyaccumulate 2didct
graphics_77.txt$sounds great doesnt it which turned out to be faster than a fast
graphics_77.txt$algorithm in this quite common case dithering is pretty standard main
graphics_77.txt$difference to the berkeley decoder except for the fewer number of supported
graphics_77.txt$algorithms is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors the default option to
graphics_77.txt$use a restricted colorspace and the implementation of a color saturation
graphics_77.txt$dominant ordered dither this leads to a significantly superior quality of
graphics_77.txt$the dithered image i claim judge yourself
graphics_77.txt$restricted colorspace means that the u and v components are clipped to
graphics_77.txt$025 instead of 05 and the display colorspace points are distributed
graphics_77.txt$over this restricted space since the distance between colorspace points
graphics_77.txt$is thus reduced by a factor of two the color resolution is doubled at the
graphics_77.txt$expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors
graphics_77.txt$saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color lying
graphics_77.txt$somewhere between the points of the display color space is approximated
graphics_77.txt$by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of
graphics_77.txt$constant saturation this yields subjectivly better quality due to the
graphics_77.txt$lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than
graphics_77.txt$to hue changes the same reasoning as used by the pal tv standard to improve
graphics_77.txt$on ntsc the improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish
graphics_77.txt$areas
