medical_560.txt$ a friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of crohns
medical_560.txt$ disease
medical_560.txt$ but she cant seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables
medical_560.txt$ without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence
medical_560.txt$ her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
medical_560.txt$ problems of people with crohns disease 
medical_560.txt$ i saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric
medical_560.txt$ thanks in advance

medical_560.txt$ all your friend really has to do is find a registered dieticianrd  while
medical_560.txt$ most work in hospitals and clinics many major cities will have rds who
medical_560.txt$ are in private practice so to speak  many physicans will refer their
medical_560.txt$ patients with crohns disease to rds for dietary help  if you can get
medical_560.txt$ your friends physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for
medical_560.txt$ the rds services just like the services of a physical therapist  the
medical_560.txt$ better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friends
medical_560.txt$ plan doesnt it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to
medical_560.txt$ control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal
medical_560.txt$ crohns disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and
medical_560.txt$ lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but
medical_560.txt$ im not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors  for
medical_560.txt$if you do a medline search on turmeric youll see that it is a potent
medical_560.txt$lipoxygenase inhibitor which is being investigated in a number of areas
medical_560.txt$im in cardiology and about 4 years ago the cardiothoracic surgery lab at my
medical_560.txt$hospital compared the effect of a teaspoon of dissolved turmeric vs a 2000
medical_560.txt$bolus of tpa in preventing myocardial reperfusion injury in a perfused
medical_560.txt$langendorff sheep heart the turmeric was more effective 
medical_560.txt$a colleague of mine in the school of pharmacy dr ron kohen has a paper in
medical_560.txt$press on the free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant activity of tea
medical_560.txt$josh
medical_560.txt$backonvmshujiacil
medical_560.txt$ bad inflammation steroids are used but for a mild case the side effects
medical_560.txt$ are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use  upjohn is developing
medical_560.txt$ a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with
medical_560.txt$ inflammatory diseases but its not available yet
