medical_691.txt$edtachelation therapy has been used by some physicians to try to remove
medical_691.txt$calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial systemnot approved for such
medical_691.txt$use  there is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung
medical_691.txt$disease has become calcifiedchest xrays would show this  there are side
medical_691.txt$effects to the use of edta because it is not specific for calciumit also
medical_691.txt$binds other minerals  i think that there have been some deaths when
medical_691.txt$edta chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that
medical_691.txt$were not detected and corrected  in animal studies the best way to remove
medical_691.txt$calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin c
medical_691.txt$and magnesiumrabbits already synthesize their own vitamin c the extra
medical_691.txt$vitamin c was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium
medical_691.txt$from the plaques
medical_691.txt$the calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably
medical_691.txt$can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form  most patietns
medical_691.txt$with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium
