technologie_73.txt$people using wireless highspeed net wifi are being warned about fake hotspots or access points
technologie_73.txt$the latest threat nicknamed evil twins pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations say cranfield university experts once logged onto an evil twin sensitive data can be intercepted wifi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability london leads the global wifi hotspots league with more than 1000 the number of hotspots is expected to reach 200000 by 2008 according to analysts users need to be wary of using their wifi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature said professor brian collins head of information systems at cranfield university
technologie_73.txt$users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wifi device has its security measures activated he added bt openzone which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the uk told the bbc news website that it made every effort to make its wifi secure naturally people may have security concerns said chris clark chief executive for bts wireless broadband
technologie_73.txt$but wifi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet like broadband or dialup he said bt openzone as well as others have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot this means that users personal information and data logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure said mr clark
technologie_73.txt$in the vast majority of cases base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible said dr nobles cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin cybercriminals dont have to be that clever to carry out such an attack said dr phil nobles a wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency
technologie_73.txt$although wifi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use highspeed net on the move there have been fears over how secure it is some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security a wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a companys computer system public wifi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud are accessible after users sign up and pay for use but many home and company wifi networks are left unprotected and can be sniffed out and hijacked by anyone with the correct equipment bt advises that customers should change all default settings make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly said mr clark we also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted dr nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the science museums dana centre in london on thursday
