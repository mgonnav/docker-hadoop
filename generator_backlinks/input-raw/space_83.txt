space_83.txt$so if your in the vehicle ready to go they better not put you on
space_83.txt$hold or else thats about it remember a liquid is several more times
space_83.txt$as dense as a gas by its very nature 10 i think depending on the gas

space_83.txt$could you use some sort of mechanical chest compression as an aid
space_83.txt$sorta like the portable iron lung   put some sort of flex tubing
space_83.txt$around the aquanauts chest  cyclically compress it  and it will
space_83.txt$push enough on the chest wall to support breathing
space_83.txt$youd have to trust your breather  but in space you have to trust
space_83.txt$your suit anyway
