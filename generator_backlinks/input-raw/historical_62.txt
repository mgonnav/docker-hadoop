historical_62.txt$on 20 february 1962 a peace accord was reached for granting independence to all of algeria7487 in their final form the évian accords allowed the piedsnoirs equal legal protection with algerians over a threeyear period these rights included respect for property participation in public affairs and a full range of civil and cultural rights at the end of that period however all algerian residents would be obliged to become algerian citizens or be classified as aliens with the attendant loss of rights the agreement also allowed france to establish military bases in algeria even after independence including the nuclear test site of regghane the naval base of merselkebir and the air base of bou sfer and to have privileges visàvis algerian oil the oas started a campaign of spectacular terrorist attacks to sabotage the évian accords hoping that if enough muslims were killed a general pogrom against the piedsnoirs would break out leading the french army to turn its guns against the government7487 despite ample provocation with oas lobbing mortar shells into the casbah of algiers the fln gave orders for no retaliatory attacks7487 in the spring of 1962 the oas turned to bank robbery to finance its war against both the fln and the french state and bombed special units sent by paris to hunt them down7493 only eighty deputies voted against the évian accords in the national assembly and cairns wrote the fulminations of jeanmarie le pen against de gaulle were only the traditional verbal excesses of thirdrate firebrands without a substantial following and without a constructive idea74
