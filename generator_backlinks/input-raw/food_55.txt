food_55.txt$egcg seems to accomplish the remarkable feat of preventing cancer cell growth by inhibiting a particular enzyme dihydrofolate reductase and according to a professor roger thorneley of the john innes center in norwich england this is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anticancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by egcg

food_55.txt$however as professor thorneley states so far there has been no determination as to how much green tea an individual would need to consume to obtain the beneficial effects provided by this compound
