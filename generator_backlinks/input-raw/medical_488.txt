medical_488.txt$a new study published by the american lung association has shown that
medical_488.txt$surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with
medical_488.txt$asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment
medical_488.txt$the seattlebased study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits
medical_488.txt$for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution
medical_488.txt$the actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed
medical_488.txt$unsafe under federal air quality laws
medical_488.txt$people with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to
medical_488.txt$exacerbate that inflammation said joel schwartz phd of the environmental
medical_488.txt$protection agency who was the lead author of the study  when people are on
medical_488.txt$the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over
medical_488.txt$the edge
medical_488.txt$the seattle study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits
medical_488.txt$with daily levels of pm or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter
medical_488.txt$of 10 microns or less  these finer particles are considered hazardous because
medical_488.txt$they are small enough penetrate into the lung  cities are considered out of
medical_488.txt$compliance with clean air laws if the 24hour average concentration of pm10
medical_488.txt$exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air
medical_488.txt$in seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at
medical_488.txt$levels as low as 30 micrograms  the authors concluded that for every 30
medical_488.txt$microgram increase in the fourday average of pm10 the odds of someone with
medical_488.txt$asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent
medical_488.txt$the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory
medical_488.txt$disease an official journal of the american thoracic society the lung
medical_488.txt$associations medical section
medical_488.txt$the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that
medical_488.txt$particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat  a 1992 study
medical_488.txt$by dr schwartz and douglas dockery phd of harvard found that particles
medical_488.txt$may be causing roughly 60000 premature deaths each year in the united states
medical_488.txt$other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms
medical_488.txt$and bronchitis in children
medical_488.txt$government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone
medical_488.txt$says dr schwartz  but more and more research is showing that particles are
medical_488.txt$bad actors as well      one problem in setting standards for particulate
medical_488.txt$air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study  unlike other regulated
medical_488.txt$pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex
medical_488.txt$and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and

medical_488.txt$researchers cant put people in exposure chambers to study the effects
medical_488.txt$of particulate air pollution says dr schwartz  we have no way of
medical_488.txt$duplicating the typical urban mix of particles   consequently most of what
medical_488.txt$is known about particulates has been learned through populationbased research
medical_488.txt$like the seattle study
medical_488.txt$given that the epas current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur
medical_488.txt$dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm10 standard any
medical_488.txt$time soon  until changes are made there appears to be little people with
medical_488.txt$asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles
medical_488.txt$in some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only
medical_488.txt$cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and thats
medical_488.txt$rarely particulate matter says dr  schwartz  however pm10 doesnt have
medical_488.txt$to be near its violation range to be unhealthy

medical_488.txt$2 thin invasive melanoma less than 1 millimeter thick has the potential
medical_488.txt$for longterm survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical

medical_488.txt$patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high

medical_488.txt$5 some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for

medical_488.txt$the cancer centers program is comprised of 55 ncidesignated cancer centers
medical_488.txt$actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer
medical_488.txt$incidence morbidity and mortality  within the program there are four types

medical_488.txt$prevention and control research
medical_488.txt$although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s it was
medical_488.txt$the national cancer act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new
medical_488.txt$cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones  the passage
medical_488.txt$of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened
medical_488.txt$the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and
medical_488.txt$cancer control research  over the next two decades the centers program grew
medical_488.txt$progressively
medical_488.txt$in 1990 there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation today
medical_488.txt$there are 28 of these institutions all of which meet specific nci criteria
medical_488.txt$for comprehensive status
medical_488.txt$to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center an
medical_488.txt$institution must pass rigorous peer review  under guidelines newly
medical_488.txt$established in 1990 the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the
medical_488.txt$requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in
medical_488.txt$several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong
medical_488.txt$program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings
medical_488.txt$into clinical practice
