space_16.txt$titan iv launches aint cheap
space_16.txt$granted but thats because titan ivs are bought by the governemnt titan
space_16.txt$iii is actually the cheapest way to put a pound in space of all us expendable
space_16.txt$launchers
space_16.txt$in that case its rather ironic that they are doing so poorly on the commercial
space_16.txt$market  is there a single titan iii on order
space_16.txt$the problem with commercial titan is that mm has made little or no attempt
space_16.txt$to market it  theyre basically happy with their government business and
space_16.txt$dont want to have to learn how to sell commercially
space_16.txt$a secondary problem is that it is a bit big  theyd need to go after
space_16.txt$multisatellite launches a la ariane and that complicates the marketing
space_16.txt$task quite significantly
space_16.txt$they also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time
space_16.txt$to get them started properly  if memory serves the pad used for the mars
space_16.txt$observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had
space_16.txt$prevented launches from it for a year or so
space_16.txt$there have been a few ct launches  mars observer was one of them  so
space_16.txt$was that stranded intelsat and at least one of its brothers that reached
space_16.txt$orbit properly
space_16.txt$all work is one mans work              henry spencer  u of toronto zoology
