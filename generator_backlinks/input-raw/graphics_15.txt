graphics_15.txt$hi
graphics_15.txt$id like to know if there is any system cpu  hd array  framebuffer
graphics_15.txt$which can play and record hdtv quality moving picture in realtime
graphics_15.txt$hdtv has about 6mbframe so recordingplaying moving picture will need
graphics_15.txt$about 180mbsec bandwidth im thinking to treat the raw data not
graphics_15.txt$compressed
graphics_15.txt$finding a disk array that can do 180mbsec will be difficult the fastest
graphics_15.txt$ones i know about are from maximum strategy ibm also sells these they
graphics_15.txt$can attach hippi at up to 144 mbsec 64 bit for these kinds of data
graphics_15.txt$rates you need more than scsi for connections their latest model the
graphics_15.txt$raid 5 model gen 4 only does 90 mbsec but i think this may be a
graphics_15.txt$limitation only of the hippi channel and that customer needs have not
graphics_15.txt$exceeded that speed since their older model was faster they are also not
graphics_15.txt$idle must be working on newer products that might be faster and are a
graphics_15.txt$small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces they
graphics_15.txt$still marketed the older faster model as of a few mongths ago

graphics_15.txt$you might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult
graphics_15.txt$to keep the hippi bus fully working at all times  sustained throughput
graphics_15.txt$might come close to maximum burst rate
graphics_15.txt$interesting problem tell us more if you can
graphics_15.txt$if anyone can advise me what kind of product i should look into please
graphics_15.txt$email me i will appriciate it the vendors email address price of
graphics_15.txt$the products actual performance data of the products any info will
