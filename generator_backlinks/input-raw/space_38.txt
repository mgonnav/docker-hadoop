space_38.txt$and had made it first  they could have beaten us if either
space_38.txt$ their rocket hadnt blown up on the pad thus setting them back
space_38.txt$andor
space_38.txt$ a saturn v went boom
space_38.txt$if they had beaten us i speculate that the us would have gone
space_38.txt$head and done some landings but we also would have been more
space_38.txt$determined to set up a base both in earth orbit and on the
space_38.txt$moon  whether or not we would be on mars by now would depend
space_38.txt$upon whether the soviets tried to go  setting up a lunar base
space_38.txt$would have stretched the budgets of both nations and i think
space_38.txt$that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value
space_38.txt$of going to mars at least in the short run  thus we would
space_38.txt$have concentrated on the moon

space_38.txt$ i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving	
space_38.txt$ the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the 	
space_38.txt$ moon and returning him safely to the earth
