space_82.txt$suppose the soviets had managed to get their moon rocket working
space_82.txt$and had made it first  they could have beaten us if either
space_82.txt$ their rocket hadnt blown up on the pad thus setting them back
space_82.txt$andor
space_82.txt$ a saturn v went boom
space_82.txt$the apollo fire was harsh a saturn v explosion would have been
space_82.txt$hurtful but the soviets winning would have been crushing that could have
space_82.txt$been the technological turning point for the us turning us
space_82.txt$from todays we can do anything were the super power to a much more
space_82.txt$reserved attitude like the soviet program today
space_82.txt$kennedy was gone by 6869 the war was still on is the east i think
space_82.txt$the program would have stalled badly and the goal of the moon
space_82.txt$by 70 would have been dead with nasa trying to figure were they went wrong
space_82.txt$if they had beaten us i speculate that the us would have gone
space_82.txt$head and done some landings but we also would have been more
space_82.txt$determined to set up a base both in earth orbit and on the
space_82.txt$moon  whether or not we would be on mars by now would depend
space_82.txt$upon whether the soviets tried to go  setting up a lunar base
space_82.txt$would have stretched the budgets of both nations and i think
space_82.txt$that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value
space_82.txt$of going to mars at least in the short run  thus we would
space_82.txt$have concentrated on the moon
space_82.txt$i speulate that
space_82.txt$the saturn program would have been pushed into
space_82.txt$the 70s with cost over runs that would just be too evil
space_82.txt$nixon still wins
space_82.txt$the shuttle was never proposed and skylab never built
space_82.txt$by 73 the program stalled yet again under the fuel crisis
space_82.txt$a string of small launches mark the mid seventies
space_82.txt$by 76 the goal of a us man on the moon is dead and the us space program
space_82.txt$drifts till the present day
space_82.txt$ james t green  jgreenoboecalpolyedu 
space_82.txt$ i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving	
space_82.txt$ the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the 	
space_82.txt$ moon and returning him safely to the earth
