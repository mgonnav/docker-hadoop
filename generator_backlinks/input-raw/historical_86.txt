historical_86.txt$jennifer keene explores the events that led up to the united states of america joining the first world war and describes the effect that participation in the war had on american social and political life
historical_86.txt$the world must be made safe for democracy proclaimed president woodrow wilson as he stood before congress asking for a declaration of war against germany after remaining neutral for nearly three years why did the united states finally decide to enter the war in april 1917 what did the war mean to americans on the home front and those who fought overseas wilsons idealistic pronouncements propelled the united states into a position of world leadership but the wars impact on american democracy was murkier
historical_86.txt$the american path to war
historical_86.txt$when the first world war began in 1914 the united states resolved to sit on the sidelines neutrality however proved easier to proclaim than maintain the expectation of a short war the american peoples diverse ancestral ties to both allied and central powers and the lack of any clear danger to us territory made wilsons decision to remain neutral both practical and popular in 1915 however the political calculus changed when britain and germany both began targeting enemy supply lines on the high seas the naval war directly affected the united states the british blockade of the north sea annoyed americans but rapidly increasing trade with britain made up for losing access to german markets the german policy of unrestricted submarine warfare however quickly became intolerable especially when american lives were lost on 7 may 1915 a german uboat torpedoed the lusitania a british passenger ship off the coast of ireland killing 1198 civilians 128 americans among them germany defended the sinking pointing out that americans had been warned to stay off ships heading into the war zone wilson nonetheless demanded that germany amend its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare by curtailing attacks on passenger and merchant ships after two more controversial sinkings germany temporarily agreed
historical_86.txt$in 1916 domestic debates over the war became more heated the preparedness movement argued that the nation was vulnerable to attack and thus needed to strengthen its military but pacifist groups such as the american union against militarism saw any increase in defence spending as a step towards war midwesterners and southerners criticised wall street for loaning money to britain and pressed for an arms embargo meanwhile people throughout the nation contributed food clothes and money to help ease civilian suffering in belgium france italy and russia few people however donated to help german civilians suffering from the effects of the blockade
historical_86.txt$finally on 2 april 1917 wilson went before congress to ask for a declaration of war wilson cited germanys decision to resume unrestricted submarine warfare its spying and sabotage operations within the united states and the zimmermann telegram an attempt to lure mexico into fighting the united states alongside germany as evidence of germanys hostile intent against the united states the president also declared that america was fighting for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples the german peoples included after a testy congressional debate the united states declared war against germany on 7 april 1917 it did not declare war against austriahungary until 7 december the united states entered the allied coalition as an associated power with no obligation to accept preexisting allied agreements on postwar territorial settlements wilson was determined to press for a peace settlement based on the principles listed in his war address and later on the fourteen points
historical_86.txt$woodrow wilsons fourteen points
historical_86.txt$wilson issued his fourteen points at a perilous moment when revolutiontorn russia was negotiating a separate peace agreement with germany in his address to congress on 8 january 1918 wilson tried unsuccessfully to convince russia to reject the punitive peace offered by germany repeating the call for a peace without victory wilson assured germany a place of equality among the peoples of the world after it evacuated all occupied territories in europe
historical_86.txt$
historical_86.txt$the majority of the fourteen points focused on settling the problems that wilson believed caused the war nationalism imperialism the arms race and territorial disagreements the final point proposed the creation of a league of nations to guarantee political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike this ambitious plan was also designed to please americans wilsons emphasis on maintaining freedom of the seas addressed the issue that had driven the united states to take up arms against germany his desire to reduce arms to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety reflected americas traditional preference for a small peacetime army finally wilson suggested redrawing boundaries in southern and eastern europe to place populations with similar ethnic identities in the same nationstates an idea that appealed to recent immigrants from these regions

historical_86.txt$the fourteen points raised hopes that a better world might emerge from the terrible slaughter germany even requested an armistice based on the fourteen points in october 1918 eager to avoid a harsh peace settlement wilson headed to the peace conference as the man of the hour but french premier georges clemenceau was more sceptical god gave us the ten commandments and we broke them wilson gives us the fourteen points we shall see he quipped foreshadowing the opposition that wilson would encounter as the victors negotiated the terms of peace

historical_86.txt$public perception of the war
historical_86.txt$official propaganda and expansive wartime sedition legislation shaped how americans talked and thought about the war speaking out against the war meant risking arrest and possible jail time with the result that only the most committed pacifists continued to criticise the war even remaining silent was not enough the government urged everyone to actively contribute to the war effort propaganda posters whipped up patriotic fervour encouraging americans to enlist in the armed forces conserve food buy liberty bonds sing patriotic songs knit socks and keep on the lookout for german spies the committee on public information orchestrated the governments wartime propaganda campaign which permeated the workplace cinema music halls and even classrooms
historical_86.txt$wilson led the nation into war with high ideals but once american soldiers began dying sentiment hardened against anything german states outlawed teaching german symphonies stopped playing works by german composers and among the large population of german americans citizens changed their last names in droves to demonstrate their loyalty vigilantes attacked people identified as progerman often forcing the accused to kiss an american flag sing the national anthem or endure physical torture

historical_86.txt$the fight for democracy at home
historical_86.txt$female suffragists and african american civil rights activists drew inspiration from wilsons promise to spread democracy radical female suffragists pioneered a new protest tactic when they decided to picket the white house to draw attention to their demand for the vote moderate suffragists chose a strategy of loyalty volunteering extensively for wartime committees to demonstrate that the nation depended on its female citizenry to defend the nation the mounting pressure eventually convinced wilson to become the first president to publicly support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing female suffrage a major step towards the eventual ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920 which officially granted the vote to women however citizenship and state laws meant that black women native american women asian women women unable to pay poll taxes and more besides were prohibited from exercising their right to vote

historical_86.txt$much to their dismay african americans discovered that it made little difference whether they served the nation loyally or protested loudly and that the nations commitment to white supremacy hardened over the course of the war however the war was a transformative moment for the african american community communitybased mobilization during the war whether to rally the black community to buy war bonds or to protest discriminatory treatment of african american soldiers benefitted the civil rights movement new leaders emerged membership in fledgling groups like the naacp national association for the advancement of colored people grew and the wars democratic rhetoric infused the movement with a new ideological focus returning black soldiers angry about the racial discrimination they encountered within the segregated wartime army helped form an ethos of fighting back both literally and figuratively which laid the foundation for a more militant postwar civil rights movement
historical_86.txt$the experiences of troops
historical_86.txt$through conscription the us army grew from a constabulary force of 300000 peacetime troops to a 42 millionstrong american expeditionary force aef over the course of 18 months the army reflected the ethnic and racial diversity of the american population and included nonenglish speaking immigrants native americans african americans hispanic americans and secondgeneration german americans the propaganda slogan americans all promoted wartime service as a unifying americanising experience that rendered differences in language culture and religion irrelevant race still mattered however the entrenched racism of white americans shaped the experiences of all troops and racial discrimination remained widespread the us wartime army was rigidly segregated and black troops who were largely under the command of white officers were subjected to poor living and working conditions

historical_86.txt$germany had taken a gamble by resuming unrestricted submarine warfare hoping to defeat the allies before the united states could make a difference in the war germany launched a series of spring offensives along the western front trying to secure a definitive breakthrough but ultimately lost this race against time in the late spring the americans fought their first battles at cantigny belleau wood and châteauthierry on the outskirts of paris then helped the allies drive the german army back throughout the summer

historical_86.txt$in the fall general john j pershing took command of an americancontrolled sector along the western front an important development that made the american military contribution highly visible pershing had successfully fended off british and french efforts to permanently amalgamate the american forces into preexisting allied armies wilson wanted american troops to play a crucial independent part in the ultimate victory thereby earning him a prominent role in shaping the peace the aef fought its last and largest battle in the meuseargonne from 26 september to 1 november 1918 its contribution to the final allied offensive that ended the war this 47day operation involved 12 million american troops and is the second most lethal battle in american history
