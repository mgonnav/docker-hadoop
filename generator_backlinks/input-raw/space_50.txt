space_50.txt$excellent discussion of dcx landing techniques by henry deleted
space_50.txt$since the dcx is to take off horizontal why not land that way
space_50.txt$the dcx will not take of horizontally  it takes of vertically
space_50.txt$why do the martian landing thing
space_50.txt$for several reasons  vertical landings dont require miles of runway and limit
space_50.txt$noise pollution  they dont require wheels or wings  just turn on the engines
space_50.txt$and touch down  of course as henry pointed out vetical landings arent quite
space_50.txt$that simple
space_50.txt$or am i missing something dont know to
space_50.txt$much about dcx and such overly obvious
space_50.txt$well to be blunt yes  but at least youre learning
space_50.txt$why not just fall to earth like the russian crafts parachute in then
space_50.txt$the soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets
space_50.txt$just before they hit the ground  parachutes are however not especially
space_50.txt$practical if you want to reuse something without much effort  the landings
space_50.txt$are also not very comfortable  however in the words of georgy grechko
space_50.txt$i prefer to have bruises not to sink
