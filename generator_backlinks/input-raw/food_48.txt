food_48.txt$this is a recipe that i like to use for turkey leftovers  i use the carcass to make the stock first  i throw in any vegetables i want to use up in the fridge into the stock pot except cabbage and broccoli and carrot greens which smell too strong if i let the stock boil too hard by accident  i simmer the stock about 2 hours or so  after straining the stock and discarding the bones and vegetables i use the following recipe from the sunset fresh ways with chicken cookbook which i usually double  i also use more broth and less turkey than they call for i really dont measure the ingredients i just add what ive got until its as thick as i want it and the proportions look right in a blender or food processor combine tomatoes and their liquid chiles and onion whirl until smooth  pour into a large pan add broth and bring to a boil over high heat  add turkey rice corn garlic and spices  reduce heat and simmer until heated through serve with fresh cilantro sour cream and tortilla strips their recipe calls for strips made from flour tortillas but i use corn sometimes too
