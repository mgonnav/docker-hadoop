space_43.txt$any comments on the absorbtion of the office of exploration into the
space_43.txt$office of space sciences and the reassignment of griffin to the chief
space_43.txt$engineer position  is this just a meaningless administrative
space_43.txt$shuffle or does this bode ill for sei
space_43.txt$in my opinion this seems like a bad thing at least on the surface
space_43.txt$griffin seemed to be someone who was actually interested in getting
space_43.txt$things done and who was willing to look an innovative approaches to
space_43.txt$getting things done faster better and cheaper  its unclear to me
space_43.txt$whether he will be able to do this at his new position
space_43.txt$does anyone know what his new duties will be
space_43.txt$first ive heard of it offhand
space_43.txt$griffin is no longer an office head so thats bad
space_43.txt$on the other hand
space_43.txt$regress seemed to think we cant fund anything by griffin because
space_43.txt$that would mean and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the
space_43.txt$ 400 billion mars mission to prove it that we would be buying into a
space_43.txt$mission to mars that would cost 400 billion therefore there will be
space_43.txt$no artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera
space_43.txt$they were killing griffins main program simply because some sycophants
space_43.txt$somewhere had congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into
space_43.txt$the same old stuff sorta like not giving aid to yeltsin because hes
space_43.txt$a communist hardliner
space_43.txt$at least now the sort of reforms griffin was trying to bring forward
space_43.txt$wont be trapped in their own little easily contained and defunded
space_43.txt$ghetto that griffin is staying in some capacity is very very very
space_43.txt$good and if he brings something up noone can say why dont you go
space_43.txt$back to the ose where you belong and where he couldnt even get money
space_43.txt$for design studies
space_43.txt$phil fraering         seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff
