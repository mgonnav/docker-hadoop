sport_97.txt$everton manager david moyes will discipline striker james beattie after all for his headbutt on chelsea defender william gallas
sport_97.txt$the scot initially defended beattie whose dismissal put everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 10 saying gallas overreacted but he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again he said i believe that i should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct moyes added my comments on saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when i had only had the opportunity to see one very quick rerun of the incident
sport_97.txt$the club website also reported that beattie who seemed unrepentant after saturdays match insisting gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if he had headbutted him has now apologised moyes continued although the incident was totally out of character  james has never even been suspended before in his career  his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his teammates james did issue a formal apology to myself his teammates and to the everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done he will now be subjected to the normal club discipline he is a competitive player but a fair player and i know how upset he is by what has happened however i must say that i do still believe the chelsea player in question did go down too easily speaking immediately after the game moyes said i dont think it was a sendingoff i have been a centrehalf in my time and i would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that
sport_97.txt$not in a million years would john terry have gone down in the same way i have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them what has happened to big strong centrehalves i thought it was a push initially and i still dont think it was a sendingoff an angry beattie initially said he gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if i had headbutted him i can tell you it wasnt an intentional headbutt we were chasing a ball into the corner and william gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off he was stopping as we were running and i said to myself if youre going to stay in my way ill go straight over you our heads barely touched and it wasnt an intentional headbutt
