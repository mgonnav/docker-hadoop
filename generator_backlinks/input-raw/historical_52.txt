historical_52.txt$when war broke out in europe in september 1939 the japanese despite a series of victorious battles had still not brought their war in china to an end on the one hand the japanese strategists had made no plans to cope with the guerrilla warfare pursued by the chinese on the other the japanese commanders in the field often disregarded the orders of the supreme command at the imperial headquarters and occupied more chinese territory than they had been ordered to take half of the japanese army was thus still tied down in china when the commitment of great britain and france to war against germany opened up the prospect of wider conquests for japan in southeast asia and in the pacific japans military ventures in china proper were consequently restricted rather more severely henceforth

historical_52.txt$the german victories over the netherlands and france in the summer of 1940 further encouraged the japanese premier prince konoe to look southward at those defeated powers colonies and also of course at the british and us positions in the far east the island archipelago of the dutch east indies now indonesia along with french indochina and britishheld malaya contained raw materials tin rubber petroleum that were essential to japans industrial economy and if japan could seize these regions and incorporate them into the empire it could make itself virtually selfsufficient economically and thus become the dominant power in the pacific ocean since great britain singlehandedly was confronting the might of the axis in europe the japanese strategists had to reckon primarily with the opposition of the united states to their plans for territorial aggrandizement when japanese troops entered northern indochina in september 1940 in pursuance of an agreement extorted in august from the vichy government of france the united states uttered a protest germany and italy by contrast recognized japan as the leading power in the far east by concluding with it the tripartite or axis pact of september 27 1940 negotiated by japanese foreign minister matsuoka yosuke the pact pledged its signatories to come to one anothers help in the event of an attack by a power not already engaged in war japan also concluded a neutrality pact with the ussr on april 13 1941

historical_52.txt$on july 2 1941 the imperial conference decided to press the japanese advance southward even at the risk of war with great britain and the united states and this policy was pursued even when matsuoka was relieved of office a fortnight later on july 26 in pursuance of a new agreement with vichy france japanese forces began to occupy bases in southern indochina

historical_52.txt$this time the united states reacted vigorously not only freezing japanese assets under us control but also imposing an embargo on supplies of oil to japan dismay at the embargo drove the japanese naval command which had hitherto been more moderate than the army into collusion with the armys extremism when negotiations with the dutch of indonesia for an alternative supply of oil produced no satisfaction the imperial conference on september 6 at the high commands insistence decided that war must be undertaken against the united states and great britain unless an understanding with the united states could be reached in a few weeks time

historical_52.txt$since peace with the united states seemed impossible japan set in motion its plans for war which would now necessarily be waged not only against the united states but also against great britain the existing war effort of which depended on us support and the far eastern colonies of which lay within the orbit of the projected japanese expansion and against the dutch east indies the oil of which was essential to japanese enterprises even apart from geopolitical considerations

historical_52.txt$the evolving japanese military strategy was based on the peculiar geography of the pacific ocean and on the relative weakness and unpreparedness of the allied military presence in that ocean the western half of the pacific is dotted with many islands large and small while the eastern half of the ocean is with the exception of the hawaiian islands almost devoid of landmasses and hence of usable bases the british french american and dutch military forces in the entire pacific region west of hawaii amounted to only about 350000 troops most of them lacking combat experience and being of disparate nationalities allied air power in the pacific was weak and consisted mostly of obsolete planes if the japanese with their large wellequipped armies that had been battlehardened in china could quickly launch coordinated attacks from their existing bases on certain japanesemandated pacific islands on formosa taiwan and from japan itself they could overwhelm the allied forces overrun the entire western pacific ocean as well as southeast asia and then develop those areas resources to their own militaryindustrial advantage if successful in their campaigns the japanese planned to establish a strongly fortified defensive perimeter extending from burma in the west to the southern rim of the dutch east indies and northern new guinea in the south and sweeping around to the gilbert and marshall islands in the southeast and east the japanese believed that any american and british counteroffensives against this perimeter could be repelled after which those nations would eventually seek a negotiated peace that would allow japan to keep her newly won empire

historical_52.txt$until the end of 1940 the japanese strategists had assumed that any new war to be waged would be against a single enemy when it became clear in 1941 that the british and the dutch as well as the americans must be attacked a new and daring war plan was successfully sponsored by the commander in chief of the combined fleet admiral yamamoto isoroku
