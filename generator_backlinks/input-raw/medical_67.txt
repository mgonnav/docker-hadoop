medical_67.txt$80 of the medical treatments are unproven and not based on scientific

medical_67.txt$medical treatments are based on science although it is difficult
medical_67.txt$to prove anything with certitude  it is true that there are some
medical_67.txt$things that have just been found to work but we have no good
medical_67.txt$explanation for why  but almost everything does have a scientific
medical_67.txt$rationale  the most common treatment for prostate cancer is
medical_67.txt$probably hormone therapy  it has been proven to work  so have
medical_67.txt$radiation and chemotherapy  what treatments did the article say
medical_67.txt$are not proven
