sport_99.txt$scotland manager walter smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the home international series
sport_99.txt$such a plan is to be proposed by the new chief executive of the northern irish fa howard wells at the next meeting of the four home countries the english fa has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season but smith said bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and thats something thats needed the home international series was done away with in 1984 with the traditional scotlandengland fixture continuing until 1989 that game is one smith would be delighted to see reinstated the scotland v england match was a highlight of the end of the season he added i was in italy for their friendly with russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around 20000 fans turned up to watch england were criticised for the 00 draw against holland  the way scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies you have to put a performance on in friendly games if you dont they can be demotivating it can be a dangerous road to go down if players dont apply themselves in the manner they should so i would support the return of the home internationals  the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule
