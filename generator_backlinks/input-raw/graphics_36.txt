graphics_36.txt$approach similar to that used in xv by john bradley the problem
graphics_36.txt$comes when i try to display the next image now i have effectively tied
graphics_36.txt$myself to the colors of the previous image so the second image doesnot come
graphics_36.txt$up in original colorsie the colors it would have shown had it been
graphics_36.txt$displayed first
graphics_36.txt$i know that i can display only 256 colors or whatever depth of the display
graphics_36.txt$at a time but i also dont want the color reproduction dependent on the
graphics_36.txt$sequence in whihc you display the image
