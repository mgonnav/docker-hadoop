graphics_95.txt$ according to the tiff 50 specification the tiff version number
graphics_95.txt$ bytes 23 42 has been chosen for its deep philosophical
graphics_95.txt$ significance
graphics_95.txt$ last week i read the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
graphics_95.txt$ is this actually how they picked the number 42
graphics_95.txt$im sure it is and i am not amused  every time i read that part of the
graphics_95.txt$tiff spec it infuriates me and im none too happy about the
graphics_95.txt$complexity of the spec anyway because i think their arbitrary but
graphics_95.txt$carefully chosen number is neither  additionally i find their
graphics_95.txt$choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves why
graphics_95.txt$not just use the letters tiff
graphics_95.txt$and no i dont think they should have bothered to support both word
graphics_95.txt$orders either and ive found that many tiff readers actually
graphics_95.txt$dont
graphics_95.txt$ab
graphics_95.txt$why so up tight  for that matter tiff6 is out now so why not gripe
graphics_95.txt$about its problems  also if its so important to you volunteer to
graphics_95.txt$help define or critique the spec
graphics_95.txt$finally a little numerology  42 is 24 backwards and tiff is a 24 bit
