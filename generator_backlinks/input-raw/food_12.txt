food_12.txt$this recipe makes about 4 dozen very crunchy biscotti  ive never put chocolate on the biscotti  you need two 12x15 inch approx cookie sheets  butter and flour one of the cookie sheets  the oven should be at 350 to roast the almonds and 300 to bake the biscotti  total baking time for the biscotti is about 2 hours  you also need to have handy and ready a surface for kneading the biscotti dough and a surface for cutting the baked biscotti  roast the almonds in a 350 degree often until lightly browned 1015 minutes  cool nuts completely lower the oven temperature to 300  in a medium bowl stir together the dry ingredients flour sugar baking soda salt just to mix  separate out about 12 cup of this mixture and spread some of the reserved 12 cup onto your kneading surface  in a small bowl or measuring cup lightly beat together the eggs and vanilla  make a well in the flour mixture in the medium bowl and pour in the eggvanilla mixture  stir the flour into the egg mixture from the outside of the well  continue combining until the mixture is too stiff to stir  turn the mixture out onto your kneading surface which should already be floured with some of the reserved dry ingredients  with floured hands use some of the reserved dry ingredients for this if you want fold the dough over itself until it coheres  use the rest of the reserved dry ingredients for your hands and the work surface if necessary  press the nuts into the dough and keep folding the dough over itself until the nuts are evenly distributed  let the dough sit a few minutes so the flour absorbs the liquid completely making the dough less sticky  divide the dough into 3 equal pieces roll each piece with your hands so that the pieces are elongated into strips about 1 wide and 1214 long  place the strips on the butteredfloured baking sheet leaving about 4 between each strip  if you want somewhat wider strips flatten the strips with your hands to a width of 2  bake for about 50 minutes at 300  let the strips cool for 5 minutes and them remove them with a spatula to a cutting surface  using a sharp knife and making downward strokes cut the strips into diagonal bars about 12 wide  lay the cut biscotti on their sides on the two baking sheets  toast 3550 minutes depending on how dark and crunchy you want them   to make much wider strips divide the dough into two strips same length 1214  each cookie will be about 6 long  this should make about 2 dozen cookies
