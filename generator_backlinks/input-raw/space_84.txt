space_84.txt$you may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of
space_84.txt$computers so much of the material below may not apply to you in
space_84.txt$general however systems connected to the net fall in one of three
space_84.txt$categories internet usenet or bitnet electronic mail may be sent
space_84.txt$between these networks and other resources available on one of these
space_84.txt$networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to
space_84.txt$special servers
space_84.txt$the space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of
space_84.txt$several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between them
space_84.txt$one mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central
space_84.txt$distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list in
space_84.txt$addition to the general lists for space called space digest for
space_84.txt$internet users and space on bitnet there are a number of more
space_84.txt$specialized mailing lists described below
space_84.txt$a second mechanism is usenet netnews this is somewhat like a bulletin
space_84.txt$board operating on each system which is a part of the net netnews
space_84.txt$separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a
space_84.txt$group name the groups dealing most closely with space topics are
space_84.txt$called scispacenews scispace scispaceshuttle sciastro
space_84.txt$and talkpoliticsspace contributors post submissions called
space_84.txt$articles in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends
space_84.txt$it to other nearby machines similarly articles sent from nearby
space_84.txt$machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so
space_84.txt$that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the usenet
space_84.txt$sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was
space_84.txt$posted
space_84.txt$gateway machines redirect the usenet scispace group into internet and
space_84.txt$bitnet mailing lists and vice versa the other usenet groups are not
space_84.txt$accessible as mailing lists if you can receive netnews its more
space_84.txt$flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make
space_84.txt$it the preferred option
space_84.txt$space digest is the main internet list and is now being run by the
space_84.txt$international space university in only its second change of management
space_84.txt$in over a decade email spacerequestisuisunetedu message body
