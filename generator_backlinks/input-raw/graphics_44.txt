graphics_44.txt$ one thing  a small change in initial conditions can cause a huge
graphics_44.txt$ change in final conditions  there are certain things about the way
graphics_44.txt$ the plate tektoniks and volcanic activity effect a land scape that
graphics_44.txt$ is while not entirely random unpredictable  this is also true with
graphics_44.txt$ fractals so one could also conclude that you could model this
graphics_44.txt$ fractally
graphics_44.txt$yeah and its also true most long complicated sequences of events
graphics_44.txt$calculations or big computer programs in general  i dont argue
graphics_44.txt$that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals i
graphics_44.txt$just question whether you should
graphics_44.txt$the fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we
graphics_44.txt$cant model should be replaced with a random number generator  that
graphics_44.txt$has been useful for instance in making data more palatable to human
graphics_44.txt$perception or for torture testing the rest of the system but i dont
graphics_44.txt$think it has much to do with fractals and i certainly would rather
graphics_44.txt$that the model be improved in a more explicable manner
graphics_44.txt$i guess i just havent seen all these earthshaking fractal models
graphics_44.txt$that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists  i
graphics_44.txt$really hope i do but im not holding my selfsimilar breath
graphics_44.txt$ there is one other thing that fractals are good for  fractal
graphics_44.txt$ image compression
graphics_44.txt$uh huh  ill believe it when i see it  ive been chasing fractal
graphics_44.txt$compression for a few years and i still dont believe in it  if its so
graphics_44.txt$great how come we dont see it competing with jpeg  cause it cant
graphics_44.txt$ill wager
graphics_44.txt$actually i have wagered i quit trying to make fractal compression
graphics_44.txt$work and i was trying because i dont think its a reasonable
graphics_44.txt$alternative to other techniques  it is neat though 
graphics_44.txt$ill reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal  thats why i
graphics_44.txt$dont think fractal compression as it is widely explained is
graphics_44.txt$practical  i know barnsley and sloan have some tricks up their
graphics_44.txt$sleeves that make their demos work but i dont see anyone using it in a
graphics_44.txt$real product  its been six years since iterated systems was formed
graphics_44.txt$right
graphics_44.txt$there are always going to be questions until theres a product
graphics_44.txt$out there sloan replies  the company plans to ship its first
graphics_44.txt$encoding devices in the summer he says  in march iterated
graphics_44.txt$systems will have the other half of the system the decoders
graphics_44.txt$ scientific american march 1990 page 77
graphics_44.txt$allen b dont even get me started
