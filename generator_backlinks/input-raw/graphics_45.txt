graphics_45.txt$ an review of both the mac and windows versions in either pc week or info
graphics_45.txt$ world this week said that the windows version was considerably slower
graphics_45.txt$ than the mac  a more useful comparison would have been between photostyler
graphics_45.txt$ and photoshop for windows  david
graphics_45.txt$i dont know about thative used photoshop 25 on both a 486dx50 and a quadra
graphics_45.txt$950id say they are roughly equal  if anything the 486 was faster
graphics_45.txt$both systems were running in 24 bit color and had the same amount of ram 16 megs
