politics_293.txt$veritas its the bnp in an expensive suit
politics_293.txt$its all well and good robert kilroysilk claiming that veritas is a party that doesnt believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the twohorse race trend in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smokescreen for his antiislamism slurs which got him sacked from the television
politics_293.txt$i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy silk opposing geoff hoon
politics_293.txt$good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done lets hope kilroysilk ukip and the eurosceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europe leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go not running away from it
politics_293.txt$all mouth and trousers a clown trouble is any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term
politics_293.txt$whatever kilroysilk and ukip do none of their antieuropean policies have any relevance outside middle england this new party might gain support from rightwing england but will have little impact in wales or scotland
politics_293.txt$hopefully this all this fighting within eurosceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better we cant rely on the usa forever
politics_293.txt$at last an impetus for increasing the likely 40 turn out for the election the electorate is disillusioned with british politics kilroy has one agenda  the uk  and ill be voting for him
politics_293.txt$both ukip and rks are representatives of smallmindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these peoples bickering that who in the overall scheme of things really cares about their petty tiff
politics_293.txt$many people believe you kilroy you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility
politics_293.txt$the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls
politics_293.txt$ive always thought that kilroysilk was a selfpublicising egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion
politics_293.txt$brilliant about time this country had a plausible party
politics_293.txt$having seen the recent bbc 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroysilk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action
politics_293.txt$fantastic news proeuropeans now have far less to worry about from the right the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid1990s and the extreme antieuropeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local european and general elections robert kilroysilks ego and vanity are his own and his supporters worst enemy
politics_293.txt$as a euroenthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroysilks behaviour he took a party that was just building up a head of steam and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coupdetat he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two the closer to straightdownthemiddle the better as far as i am concerned but in any eventuality the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other
politics_293.txt$if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose wed have ballot papers a mile long youve got to hand it to kilroysilk for his sheer arrogance and supreme selfbelief
politics_293.txt$whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership and like him i am also leaving ukip i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means the eus comments last week about michael howards plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states the sooner we leave this corrupt superstate the better
politics_293.txt$does anyone else think that it is ironic that eurosceptic kilroysilk has used a latin name for his new party rather than a good old british name is this indicative of the man  contradictory vain and pompous
politics_293.txt$i think mr kilroysilk has got a very good point british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped if mr kilroysilk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote
politics_293.txt$honestly who really cares man with tan leaves party with no plan to set up party with no idea
politics_293.txt$as one of kilroysilks east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament
politics_293.txt$ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukips democratic nature
politics_293.txt$kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not he tried to make it work but they didnt seem to want to grow up he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy good luck to the man i say
politics_293.txt$oh please this is an amusing irrelevance there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive eurosceptic argument they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed more democratic more dynamic europe union future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness
politics_293.txt$the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open honest and straight what other politician can claim this i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like i shall be voting for him
politics_293.txt$the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroysilk but for the ukip kilroysilk was made an mep because of his position on the ukips party list he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament
politics_293.txt$i wouldnt write off kilroysilk while hes a clown and a one man band at the moment hes a populist and thats always dangerousthe man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters that seems to be one of the factors in success
politics_293.txt$good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle
politics_293.txt$the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my countrys knight in shining armour he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today  but people are almost too scared to express them kilroy silk has secured my vote and many more like me whats more i look forward to the day when he claims victory wrecks the eu and rescues my great nation without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever
politics_293.txt$great stuff the longer the uk dithers over europe the richer we in ireland become as the only englishspeaking country fully committed to europe oh and send us over those hardworking immigrants  our economy needs them
politics_293.txt$this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further
politics_293.txt$thank goodness that kilroysilk has gone  now ukip at least has a chance in the election
politics_293.txt$it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroysilk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroysilk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in infighting
politics_293.txt$ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroysilk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroysilk
politics_293.txt$if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a byelections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another
politics_293.txt$so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow
politics_293.txt$interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name
politics_293.txt$every opinion poll points to an overwhelming antieurope feeling in this country kilroysilk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroysilk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come
politics_293.txt$well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party its all flash and no real policy here
politics_293.txt$lets hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroysilk slipping into obscurity
politics_293.txt$veritas the name will doom it but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the tootwee label of veritas symbolises that
