space_22.txt$ the real reason why accelerator breeders or incinerators are not being
space_22.txt$ built is that there isnt any reason to do so  natural uranium is
space_22.txt$ still too cheap and geological disposal of actinides looks
space_22.txt$ technically reasonable
space_22.txt$	novemberdecember 1987 page 21  science and technology in japan
space_22.txt$			seawater uranium recovery experiment
space_22.txt$	the ground uranium reserves are estimated at about 36 million tons
space_22.txt$ and it is anticipated that the demand and supply balance will collapse by the
space_22.txt$ end of the 20th century  in japan a resources poor country technological
space_22.txt$ development are now under way to economically collect uranium dissolved in
space_22.txt$ seawater  the total quanity of uranium dissolved in seawater is estimated
space_22.txt$ to be about 46 billion tons a huge amount when compared with ground uranium
space_22.txt$ reserves
space_22.txt$i hate to pour cold water on this but currently seawater extracted
space_22.txt$uranium even using the new improved fiber absorbers from japan is
space_22.txt$about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market
space_22.txt$uranium is very cheap right now around 10lb  right now there
space_22.txt$are mines closing because they cant compete with places like cigar
space_22.txt$lake in canada where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards
space_22.txt$to the mines who work in shielded vehicles  plenty of other sources
space_22.txt$for example uranium from phosphate processing would come on line before
space_22.txt$uranium reached 200lb
space_22.txt$demand and supply balance will collapse is nonsense  supply and
space_22.txt$demand always balance what changes is the price  is uranium going
space_22.txt$to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century
space_22.txt$not bloody likely  new nuclear reactors are not being built
space_22.txt$at a sufficient rate
space_22.txt$uranium from seawater is interesting but its a long term project or
space_22.txt$a project that the japanese might justify on grounds of
space_22.txt$selfsufficiency
