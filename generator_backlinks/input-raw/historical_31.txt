historical_31.txt$the planning and conduct of war in 1914 were crucially influenced by the invention of new weapons and the improvement of existing types since the francogerman war of 187071 the chief developments of the intervening period had been the machine gun and the rapidfire field artillery gun the modern machine gun which had been developed in the 1880s and 90s was a reliable beltfed gun capable of sustained rates of extremely rapid fire it could fire 600 bullets per minute with a range of more than 1000 yards 900 metres in the realm of field artillery the period leading up to the war saw the introduction of improved breechloading mechanisms and brakes without a brake or recoil mechanism a gun lurched out of position during firing and had to be reaimed after each round the new improvements were epitomized in the french 75millimetre field gun it remained motionless during firing and it was not necessary to readjust the aim in order to bring sustained fire on a target
