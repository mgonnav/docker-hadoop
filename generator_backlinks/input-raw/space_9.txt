space_9.txt$cassini  saturn orbiter and titan atmosphere probe cassini is a joint
space_9.txt$nasaesa project designed to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian
space_9.txt$system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe cassini
space_9.txt$is scheduled for launch aboard a titan ivcentaur in october of 1997
space_9.txt$after gravity assists of venus earth and jupiter in a vvejga
space_9.txt$trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004 upon
space_9.txt$arrival the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
space_9.txt$orbit around saturn near the end of this initial orbit the huygens
space_9.txt$probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
space_9.txt$titan the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about 3 hours
space_9.txt$while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
space_9.txt$surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter
space_9.txt$continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years titan
space_9.txt$synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of titan and
space_9.txt$targeted flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objectives of the
space_9.txt$mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of saturns atmosphere
space_9.txt$rings and magnetosphere conduct closeup studies of saturns
space_9.txt$satellites and characterize titans atmosphere and surface
space_9.txt$one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its
space_9.txt$surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
space_9.txt$result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere these
space_9.txt$hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
space_9.txt$down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
space_9.txt$peer through titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
space_9.txt$surface experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
space_9.txt$investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere
space_9.txt$the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini 16251712 the
space_9.txt$first director of the paris observatory who discovered several of
space_9.txt$saturns satellites and the major division in its rings the titan
space_9.txt$atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan
