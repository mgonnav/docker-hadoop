space_93.txt$ does anyone have any info on the apparent sightings of vulcan
space_93.txt$ all that i know is that there were apparently two sightings at
space_93.txt$ drastically different times of a small planet that was inside mercurys
space_93.txt$ orbit  beyond that i have no other info
space_93.txt$the sightings were apparently spurious  there is no planet inside of
space_93.txt$the orbit of mercury
space_93.txt$the idea of vulcan came from the differences between mercurys observed
space_93.txt$perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to
space_93.txt$newtonian physics  leverrier made an extensive set of observations
space_93.txt$and calculations during the mid 19th century and simon newcombe later
space_93.txt$improved on the observations and recalculated using leverriers system
space_93.txt$of equations  now leverrier was one of the codiscoverers of neptune
space_93.txt$and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit
space_93.txt$of uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was
space_93.txt$afoot with mercury
space_93.txt$but alas twere not so  mercurys perihelion precesses at the rate
space_93.txt$it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly
space_93.txt$curved due to the suns mass  this explanation had to wait until 1915
space_93.txt$and albert einsteins synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics
space_93.txt$of moving bodies commonly called special relativity with reimanian
space_93.txt$geometry  the result was the general theory of relativity and one of
space_93.txt$its most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession
space_93.txt$of mercurys perihelion almost exactly  exactly if you use newcombs
space_93.txt$numbers rather than leverriers
space_93.txt$of course not everybody believes einstein and thats fine  but subsequent
space_93.txt$efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than mercury using radar
space_93.txt$have been fruitless
space_93.txt$bill gawne
space_93.txt$forgive him he is a barbarian who thinks the customs of his tribe
space_93.txt$are the laws of the universe                        g j caesar
