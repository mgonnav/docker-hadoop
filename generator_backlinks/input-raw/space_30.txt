space_30.txt$the following answer and translation are provided by ken jenks
space_30.txt$kjenksgothamcityjscnasagov
space_30.txt$the ascent guidance and flight control training manual asc gc 2102
space_30.txt$says
space_30.txt$during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is
space_30.txt$commanded until an iloaded vrel sufficient to assure launch tower
space_30.txt$clearance is achieved then the tilt maneuver roll program
space_30.txt$orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a
space_30.txt$negative qalpha which in turn alleviates structural loading other
space_30.txt$advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort
space_30.txt$maneuver complexity improved sband look angles and crew view of
space_30.txt$the horizon the tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining
space_30.txt$downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff meco target
space_30.txt$in second stage
space_30.txt$this really is a good answer but its couched in nasa jargon ill try
space_30.txt$to interpret
space_30.txt$1	we wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling
space_30.txt$2	then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack
space_30.txt$between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the
space_30.txt$relative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line
space_30.txt$between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly
space_30.txt$negative angle a negative qalpha	this causes a little bit of
space_30.txt$downward force toward the belly of the orbiter or the z
space_30.txt$direction and this force alleviates structural loading
space_30.txt$we have to be careful about those wings  theyre about the
space_30.txt$most delicate part of the vehicle
space_30.txt$3	the new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more
space_30.txt$mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or
space_30.txt$to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be
space_30.txt$the case if we didnt roll performance gain
space_30.txt$4	the new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated
space_30.txt$flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort
space_30.txt$maneuvers the return to launch site decreased abort maneuver
space_30.txt$complexity
space_30.txt$5	the new attitude improves the ability for groundbased radio
space_30.txt$antennae to have a good lineofsight signal with the sband radio
space_30.txt$antennae on the orbiter improved sband look angles
space_30.txt$6	the new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a
space_30.txt$helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine
space_30.txt$7	the new attitude orients the shuttle so that the body is
space_30.txt$more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east
space_30.txt$usually  this allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity
space_30.txt$in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit  remember
space_30.txt$velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction
space_30.txt$the shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its
space_30.txt$velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit
space_30.txt$this all begs the question why isnt the launch pad oriented to give
space_30.txt$this nice attitude to begin with  why does the shuttle need to roll to
space_30.txt$achieve that attitude  the answer is that the pads were leftovers
space_30.txt$from the apollo days  the shuttle straddles two flame trenches  one
space_30.txt$for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main
space_30.txt$engine exhaust  you can see the effects of this on any daytime
space_30.txt$launch  the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust is
space_30.txt$fluffy white steam  watch for the difference between the top
space_30.txt$orbiter side and the bottom external tank side of the stack the
space_30.txt$access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented
space_30.txt$basically the same way they were for the saturn vs  a side note the
space_30.txt$saturn vs also had a roll program  dont ask me why  im a shuttle
space_30.txt$guy
space_30.txt$i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics	he added that the roll
space_30.txt$maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw
space_30.txt$the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons
space_30.txt$stated  the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping
space_30.txt$the angle of attack qalpha within a tight tolerance  the yaw
space_30.txt$component is used to determine the orbital inclination  the total
