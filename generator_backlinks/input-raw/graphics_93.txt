graphics_93.txt$ we have heard many bad things about the ati ultra plus card mainly having
graphics_93.txt$ to do with its buggy windows drivers
graphics_93.txt$ i would like to replace by ati graphics ultra with a truecolour accelerated
graphics_93.txt$ card i was about to buy the ati ultra plus eisa but it has had so much
graphics_93.txt$ bad press that i am reconsidering
graphics_93.txt$ i have the ati graphics ultra pro eisa version  i must admit it has
graphics_93.txt$ received bad press but that was due to the faulty drivers it had  now the
graphics_93.txt$ drivers that are available for the eisa version are the same ones as the isa
graphics_93.txt$ and local bus v15 build 59  some people complained about problems they
graphics_93.txt$ had with the build 59 drivers fortunately i couldnt duplicate them on my
graphics_93.txt$ machine but i did have one problem with harvard graphics that nobody else
graphics_93.txt$ seemed to have
graphics_93.txt$ i would like an accelerated card
graphics_93.txt$              a card that does 24bit true colour at 800x600 at least
graphics_93.txt$              a card that does 1024x758 at 256 colours or more
graphics_93.txt$              a card that has fast polygon fills
graphics_93.txt$              a card that has fast bit blits
graphics_93.txt$              a card that has a robust windows driver
graphics_93.txt$              a card that has high speed noninterlaced refresh
graphics_93.txt$ any suggestions
graphics_93.txt$ i wouldnt recommed the ati for 24bit colour at 800x600 at this resolution
graphics_93.txt$ the display will be interlaced  but at 16bit it isnt i thought it was my
graphics_93.txt$this doesnt sound right to me  i have an ati ultra pro vlb card with 2mb
graphics_93.txt$vram and im pretty sure it is not interlaced at 800x600 in 24bit mode  im
graphics_93.txt$at work right now so i cant check it out but i know that when i set it up
graphics_93.txt$the utility let me specify noninterlaced for this mode  and i havent
graphics_93.txt$noticed it the couple times that i have put the card in this mode in windows
graphics_93.txt$but i could be wrong because i very rarely use this mode  for most of my
graphics_93.txt$applications at home 1024x768x16bpp is what i use
graphics_93.txt$cheers
graphics_93.txt$phil
graphics_93.txt$ monitor but it isnt its the card that is the only time you will get
graphics_93.txt$ interlaced  if i come up with cards more suited for your needs ill let
graphics_93.txt$ you know
