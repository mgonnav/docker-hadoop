medical_644.txt$rates of cesarean delivery  united states 1991
medical_644.txt$cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly 1 million of the
medical_644.txt$approximately 4 million annual deliveries in the united states since 1986
medical_644.txt$table 1 the cesarean rate in the united states is the third highest among
medical_644.txt$21 reporting countries exceeded only by brazil and puerto rico 1 this
medical_644.txt$report presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdcs national hospital
medical_644.txt$discharge survey nhds for 1991 and compares these data with previous years
medical_644.txt$data on discharges from shortstay nonfederal hospitals have been
medical_644.txt$collected annually since 1965 in the nhds conducted by cdcs national center
medical_644.txt$for health statistics for 1991 medical and demographic information were
medical_644.txt$abstracted from a sample of 274000 inpatients discharged from 484
medical_644.txt$participating hospitals the 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior
medical_644.txt$cesarean vbac presented in this report are based on weighted national
medical_644.txt$estimates from the nhds sample of approximately 31000 11 women discharged
medical_644.txt$after delivery the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were
medical_644.txt$calculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births from
medical_644.txt$national vital registration data therefore estimates of the number of
medical_644.txt$cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based
medical_644.txt$solely on the nhds 2 stated differences in this analysis are significant at
medical_644.txt$the 95 confidence level based on the twotailed ttest with a critical value
medical_644.txt$of 196
medical_644.txt$in 1991 there were 235 cesareans per 100 deliveries the same rate as
medical_644.txt$in 1990 and similar to rates during 19861989 table 1 the primary cesarean
medical_644.txt$rate ie number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no
medical_644.txt$previous cesareans for 19861991 also was stable ranging from 168 to 175
medical_644.txt$in 1991 the cesarean rate in the south was 276 significantly p005
medical_644.txt$higher than the rates for the west 198 midwest 218 and northeast
medical_644.txt$226 rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years
medical_644.txt$than for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or
medical_644.txt$government hospitals in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger
medical_644.txt$hospitals and for deliveries for which blue crossblue shield  and other
medical_644.txt$private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of
medical_644.txt$payment table 2 the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries
medical_644.txt$since the early 1970s the number and percentage of births to older women
medical_644.txt$increased however if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained
medical_644.txt$the same as in 1986 the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 233
medical_644.txt$essentially the same as the 235 observed
medical_644.txt$based on the nhds of the approximately 4111000 live births in 1991 an

medical_644.txt$distress and 137 with all other specified complications
medical_644.txt$the average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 28 days in
medical_644.txt$comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 45 days
medical_644.txt$and for a repeat cesarean 42 days  nearly twice the duration for vbac
medical_644.txt$deliveries 22 days or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs 23
medical_644.txt$days in 1986 the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 32 days for
medical_644.txt$primary cesareans 52 days for repeat cesareans 47 days and for vbac and
medical_644.txt$nonvbac vaginal deliveries 27 and 26 days respectively
medical_644.txt$reported by office of vital and health statistics systems national center
medical_644.txt$for health statistics cdc
medical_644.txt$editorial note the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from
medical_644.txt$1965 through 1986 however the findings in this report indicate that rates
medical_644.txt$have been stable since 1986 3 because there is little evidence that
medical_644.txt$maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because
medical_644.txt$cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of
medical_644.txt$childbirth a national health objective for the year 2000 4 is to reduce the
medical_644.txt$overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary
medical_644.txt$cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries objective 148
medical_644.txt$postpartum complications  including urinary tract and wound infections
medical_644.txt$ may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries
medical_644.txt$than for vaginal births 5 moreover the prolonged hospital stays for
medical_644.txt$cesarean deliveries substantially increase healthcare costs for example in
medical_644.txt$1991 the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were 7826 and
medical_644.txt$4720 respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes
medical_644.txt$611 for physician fees and 2495 for hospital charges 6 if the cesarean
medical_644.txt$rate in 1991 had been 15 the year 2000 objective instead of 235 the number
medical_644.txt$of cesarean births would have decreased by 349000 617000 versus 966000
medical_644.txt$resulting in a savings of more than 1 billion in physician fees and hospital
medical_644.txt$charges
medical_644.txt$despite the steady increase in vbac rates since 1986 several factors may
medical_644.txt$impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean
medical_644.txt$delivery for example vbac rates substantially reflect the number of women
medical_644.txt$offered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 7
medical_644.txt$of women who are offered a trial of labor 5070 could deliver vaginally 7
medical_644.txt$a level already achieved by many hospitals 8 trial of labor was routinely
medical_644.txt$offered in 46 of hospitals surveyed in 1984 the most recent year for which
