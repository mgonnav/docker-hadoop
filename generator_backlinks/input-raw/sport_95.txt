sport_95.txt$wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarterfinals
sport_95.txt$rooney received a hostile reception but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park fortune headed home after 23 minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes freekick marcus bent missed evertons best chance when roy carroll who was later struck by a missile saved at his feet
sport_95.txt$rooneys return was always going to be a potential flashpoint and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kickoff and rooneys every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19yearold everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goalline but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up fortune gave united the lead after 23 minutes rising to meet ronaldos cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith united dominated without creating too many clearcut chances and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before halftime mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent played onside by gabriel heintze hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save united almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when ronaldos low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off tony hibbert but martyn dived to save brilliantly and martyn came to evertons rescue three minutes later when rooneys big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage scholes freekick took a deflection and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo who reacted first to score easily evertons problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal rooneys desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injurytime when he outpaced stubbs but once again martyn denied the england striker
