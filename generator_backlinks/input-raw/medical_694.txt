medical_694.txt$to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics  gorden
medical_694.txt$rubenfeld through email has assured me that most physicians recognize
medical_694.txt$the chance of candida blooms occuring after broadspectrum antibiotic use
medical_694.txt$and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to
medical_694.txt$restore competetion for candida in the body  i do not believe that this is
medical_694.txt$yet a standard part of medical practice
medical_694.txt$   nor is it mine  what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly
medical_694.txt$ understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections
medical_694.txt$  which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections
medical_694.txt$ marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians and
medical_694.txt$ biochemists  anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns
medical_694.txt$ this at some centers preop liver transplant patients receive bowel
medical_694.txt$ decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt
medical_694.txt$ to prevent fungal colonization in this soontobe high risk group  i also
medical_694.txt$ use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may
medical_694.txt$ be in part due to alterations in gut flora  however it is not part of
medical_694.txt$ my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after
medical_694.txt$ antibiotics  i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating
medical_694.txt$ fungal infections in at risk patients  whether or not it is a logical
medical_694.txt$ extension from the available observations ill leave to those of you who
medical_694.txt$ base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of
medical_694.txt$ clinical trials
medical_694.txt$   one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly
medical_694.txt$ recalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection there
medical_694.txt$ are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate
medical_694.txt$ the patients flora  dont try this at home
medical_694.txt$not give give her advise to use the otc antifungal creams  since candida
medical_694.txt$colonizes primarily in the anorectal area gi symptoms should be more common
medical_694.txt$than vaginal problems after broadspectrum antibiotic use
medical_694.txt$   except that it isnt at least symptomatically apparent disease
medical_694.txt$medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way  there
medical_694.txt$has always been the use of conventional wisdom  a very good example is
medical_694.txt$kidney stones  conventional wisdombecause clinical trails have not been
medical_694.txt$done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the
medical_694.txt$intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones
medical_694.txt$from forming  clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to
medical_694.txt$breakdown the stone once it formed  through the recent new england j of
medical_694.txt$medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong
medical_694.txt$increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is
medical_694.txt$restricting calcium intake
medical_694.txt$   seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal
medical_694.txt$ conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical
medical_694.txt$ trial like
medical_694.txt$ au   dismukeswe  wadejs  leejy  dockerybk  hainjd
medical_694.txt$ ti   a randomized doubleblind trial of nystatin therapy for the
medical_694.txt$      candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments
medical_694.txt$ so   nengljmed  1990 dec 20  32325  p 171723
medical_694.txt$      psychological tests results the three activetreatment regimens
medical_694.txt$      and the allplacebo regimen
medical_694.txt$      significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less than
medical_694.txt$      0001 but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms
medical_694.txt$      significantly more than placebo     
medical_694.txt$      conclusions in women with presumed candidiasis
medical_694.txt$      hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or
medical_694.txt$      psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo consequently
medical_694.txt$      the empirical recommendation of longterm nystatin therapy for such
medical_694.txt$      women appears to be unwarranted
medical_694.txt$   does this trial address every issue raised here no  jon noring was not
medical_694.txt$ surprised at this negative trial since they didnt use sporanox despite
medical_694.txt$ crooks recommendation for nystatin  maybe they didnt avoid those
medical_694.txt$ carbohydrates   
medical_694.txt$the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to
medical_694.txt$be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy
medical_694.txt$if it makes sense for livestock why doesnt it make sense for humans
medical_694.txt$david  we are not talking about a dangerous treatmentunless you consider
medical_694.txt$yogurt dangerous  if this were a standard part of medical practice as
medical_694.txt$gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast
medical_694.txt$infections should decline
medical_694.txt$   marty youve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric
medical_694.txt$ itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic
medical_694.txt$ hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin
medical_694.txt$ therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with
medical_694.txt$ systemic symptoms  there is significant difference between the cost and
medical_694.txt$ risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials  are we talking about real
medical_694.txt$ candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy
medical_694.txt$ of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally
medical_694.txt$ effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm
medical_694.txt$ an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc  we cant seem to
medical_694.txt$ focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion
medical_694.txt$                            im lost
medical_694.txt$candida can do that to you   gordon i think that the best clinical
medical_694.txt$trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal
medical_694.txt$candida blooms l acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the
medical_694.txt$frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the
medical_694.txt$candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and l acidophilus
medical_694.txt$should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the
medical_694.txt$intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to
medical_694.txt$oxygenjust like it does in the vagina  as much stuff as there is in the
medical_694.txt$lay press about l acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections im really
medical_694.txt$amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out
medical_694.txt$the calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all
medical_694.txt$conventional wisdom out the window  where would medicine be if
medical_694.txt$conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard
medical_694.txt$medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials
medical_694.txt$the clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical sceneand a very
medical_694.txt$important one  the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria
medical_694.txt$after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason
medical_694.txt$to dismiss it outofhand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply
medical_694.txt$and safelylike it is in animal husbandry
