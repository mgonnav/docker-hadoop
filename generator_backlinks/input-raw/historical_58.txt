historical_58.txt$during 1956 and 1957 the fln successfully applied hitandrun tactics in accordance with guerrilla warfare theory whilst some of this was aimed at military targets a significant amount was invested in a terror campaign against those in any way deemed to support or encourage french authority this resulted in acts of sadistic torture and brutal violence against all including women and children specializing in ambushes and night raids and avoiding direct contact with superior french firepower the internal forces targeted army patrols military encampments police posts and colonial farms mines and factories as well as transportation and communications facilities once an engagement was broken off the guerrillas merged with the population in the countryside in accordance with maos theories kidnapping was commonplace as were the ritual murder and mutilation of civilians55dubious  discuss see torture section
