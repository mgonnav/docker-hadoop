space_54.txt$mariner 1 the first us attempt to send a spacecraft to venus failed
space_54.txt$minutes after launch in 1962 the guidance instructions from the ground
space_54.txt$stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the
space_54.txt$onboard computer took control however there turned out to be a bug in
space_54.txt$the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the
space_54.txt$range safety officer destroyed it although the bug is sometimes claimed
space_54.txt$to have been an incorrect fortran do statement it was actually a
space_54.txt$transcription error in which the bar indicating smoothing was omitted
space_54.txt$from the expression rdotbar sub n nth smoothed value of derivative
space_54.txt$of radius this error led the software to treat normal minor variations
space_54.txt$of velocity as if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation
space_54.txt$mariner 2 became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december
space_54.txt$of 1962 and it returned information which confirmed that venus is a
space_54.txt$very hot 800 degrees fahrenheit now revised to 900 degrees f world
space_54.txt$with a cloudcovered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide
space_54.txt$sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978
space_54.txt$mariner 3 launched on november 5 1964 was lost when its protective
space_54.txt$shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary
space_54.txt$space unable to collect the suns energy for power from its solar
space_54.txt$panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in
space_54.txt$solar orbit it was intended for a mars flyby with mariner 4
space_54.txt$mariner 4 the sister probe to mariner 3 did reach mars in 1965 and
space_54.txt$took the first closeup images of the martian surface 22 in all as it
space_54.txt$flew by the planet the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere
space_54.txt$much thinner than previously thought many scientists concluded from
space_54.txt$this preliminary scan that mars was a dead world in both the
space_54.txt$geological and biological sense
space_54.txt$mariner 5 was sent to venus in 1967 it reconfirmed the data on that
space_54.txt$planet collected five years earlier by mariner 2 plus the information
space_54.txt$that venus atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times
space_54.txt$that of earths or the equivalent of being 3300 feet under the surface
space_54.txt$of an ocean
space_54.txt$mariner 6 and 7 were sent to mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work
space_54.txt$done by mariner 4 four years earlier however they failed to take away
space_54.txt$the concept of mars as a dead planet first made from the basic
space_54.txt$measurements of mariner 4
space_54.txt$mariner 8 ended up in the atlantic ocean in 1971 when the rocket
space_54.txt$launcher autopilot failed
space_54.txt$mariner 9 the sister probe to mariner 8 became the first craft to
space_54.txt$orbit mars in 1971 it returned information on the red planet that no
space_54.txt$other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes on the martian
space_54.txt$surface as well as giant canyon systems and evidence that water once
space_54.txt$flowed across the planet the probe also took the first detailed closeup
space_54.txt$images of mars two small moons phobos and deimos
space_54.txt$mariner 10 used venus as a gravity assist to mercury in 1974 the probe
space_54.txt$did return the first closeup images of the venusian atmosphere in
space_54.txt$ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover
space_54.txt$plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four
space_54.txt$earth days mariner 10 eventually made three flybys of mercury from 1974
space_54.txt$to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas the probe revealed
space_54.txt$mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than
space_54.txt$thought this would seem to indicate that mercury has an iron core which
space_54.txt$makes up 75 percent of the entire planet
space_54.txt$pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiters
space_54.txt$pioneer 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective  to photograph
space_54.txt$the moon closeup  but they did reach far enough into space to provide
space_54.txt$new information on the area between earth and the moon including new
space_54.txt$data on the van allen radiation belts circling earth all three craft
space_54.txt$had failures with their rocket launchers pioneer 1 was launched on
space_54.txt$october 11 1958 pioneer 2 on november 8 and pioneer 3 on december 6
space_54.txt$pioneer 4 was a moon probe which missed the moon and became the first
space_54.txt$us spacecraft to orbit the sun in 1959 pioneer 5 was originally
space_54.txt$designed to flyby venus but the mission was scaled down and it instead
space_54.txt$studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to
space_54.txt$362 million kilometers in 1960 a record until mariner 2 pioneer 6
space_54.txt$through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968 pioneer 6 7
space_54.txt$and 8 are still transmitting information at this time pioneer e would
space_54.txt$have been number 10 suffered a launch failure in 1969
space_54.txt$pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in 1973 pioneer
space_54.txt$11 followed it in 1974 and then went on to become the first probe to
space_54.txt$study saturn in 1979 both vehicles should continue to function through
space_54.txt$1995 and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever
space_54.txt$to do so
space_54.txt$pioneer venus 1 1978 also known as pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer
space_54.txt$12 burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october 8 1992 pvo made
space_54.txt$the first radar studies of the planets surface via probe pioneer venus
space_54.txt$2 also known as pioneer 13 sent four small probes into the atmosphere
space_54.txt$in december of 1978 the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the
space_54.txt$atmosphere while the four probes descended by parachute towards the
space_54.txt$surface though none were expected to survive to the surface the day
space_54.txt$probe did make it and transmitted for 675 minutes on the ground before
space_54.txt$its batteries failed
space_54.txt$ranger 1 and 2 were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series they
space_54.txt$were meant for high earth orbit testing in 1961 but rocket problems
space_54.txt$left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed
space_54.txt$ranger 3 launched on january 26 1962 was intended to land an
space_54.txt$instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problems during the
space_54.txt$launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit
space_54.txt$ranger 3 did try to take some images of the moon as it flew by but the
space_54.txt$camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt
space_54.txt$ranger 4 launched april 23 1962 had the same purpose as ranger 3 but
space_54.txt$suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside
space_54.txt$the first us probe to reach the moon albeit without returning data
space_54.txt$ranger 5 launched october 18 1962 and similar to ranger 3 and 4 lost
space_54.txt$all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon
space_54.txt$and drifted off into solar orbit
space_54.txt$ranger 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions they were to send
space_54.txt$back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact
space_54.txt$with the moon ranger 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras
space_54.txt$did not operate ranger 7 through 9 performed well becoming the first
space_54.txt$us lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965
space_54.txt$lunar orbiter 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the moon and image
space_54.txt$various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned apollo
space_54.txt$missions of 19691972 the probes also contributed greatly to our
space_54.txt$understanding of lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside
space_54.txt$all five probes of the series launched from 1966 to 1967 were
space_54.txt$essentially successful in their missions they were the first us
space_54.txt$probes to orbit the moon all los were eventually crashed into the lunar
space_54.txt$surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo missions
space_54.txt$the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar
space_54.txt$module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the
space_54.txt$soil before this time it was feared by some that the moon was covered
space_54.txt$in great layers of dust which would not support a heavy landing
space_54.txt$vehicle surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was
space_54.txt$strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968
space_54.txt$only surveyor 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions the rest became the
space_54.txt$first us probes to soft land on the moon taking thousands of images
space_54.txt$and scooping the soil for analysis apollo 12 landed 600 feet from
space_54.txt$surveyor 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to earth surveyor 7
space_54.txt$the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which explored
space_54.txt$the tycho crater region in 1968
space_54.txt$viking 1 was launched from cape canaveral florida on august 20 1975 on
space_54.txt$a titan 3ecentaur d1 rocket the probe went into martian orbit on june
space_54.txt$19 1976 and the lander set down on the western slopes of chryse
space_54.txt$planitia on july 20 1976 it soon began its programmed search for
space_54.txt$martian microorganisms there is still debate as to whether the probes
space_54.txt$found life there or not and sent back incredible color panoramas of
space_54.txt$its surroundings one thing scientists learned was that mars sky was
space_54.txt$pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought the sky is
space_54.txt$pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the
space_54.txt$thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and
space_54.txt$boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image
space_54.txt$the viking 1 orbiter kept functioning until august 7 1980 when it ran
space_54.txt$out of attitudecontrol propellant the lander was switched into a
space_54.txt$weatherreporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep
space_54.txt$functioning through 1994 but after november 13 1982 an errant command
space_54.txt$had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until
space_54.txt$further orders communication was never regained again despite the
space_54.txt$engineers efforts through may of 1983
space_54.txt$an interesting side note viking 1s lander has been designated the
space_54.txt$thomas a mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the
space_54.txt$lander imaging team the national air and space museum in washington
space_54.txt$dc is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until
space_54.txt$it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition
space_54.txt$viking 2 was launched on september 9 1975 and arrived in martian orbit
space_54.txt$on august 7 1976 the lander touched down on september 3 1976 in
space_54.txt$utopia planitia it accomplished essentially the same tasks as its
space_54.txt$sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording
space_54.txt$one marsquake the orbiter had a series of attitudecontrol gas leaks in
space_54.txt$1978 which prompted it being shut down that july the lander was shut
space_54.txt$down on april 12 1980
space_54.txt$the orbits of both viking orbiters should decay around 2025
space_54.txt$voyager 1 was launched september 5 1977 and flew past jupiter on march
space_54.txt$5 1979 and by saturn on november 13 1980 voyager 2 was launched
space_54.txt$august 20 1977 before voyager 1 and flew by jupiter on august 7
space_54.txt$1979 by saturn on august 26 1981 by uranus on january 24 1986 and
space_54.txt$by neptune on august 8 1989 voyager 2 took advantage of a rare
space_54.txt$onceevery189years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to
space_54.txt$outer planet voyager 1 could in principle have headed towards pluto
space_54.txt$but jpl opted for the sure thing of a titan close up

space_54.txt$satellites and their rings has become immense voyager 12 discovered
space_54.txt$that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and
space_54.txt$aurorae three new satellites were discovered two of the major
space_54.txt$surprises were that jupiter has rings and that io has active sulfurous
space_54.txt$volcanoes with major effects on the jovian magnetosphere
space_54.txt$when the two probes reached saturn they discovered over 1000 ringlets
space_54.txt$and 7 satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep

space_54.txt$is known titans atmosphere was smoggy mimas appearance was
space_54.txt$startling one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance
space_54.txt$the big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings braids
space_54.txt$kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain
space_54.txt$voyager 2 thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts
space_54.txt$continued the mission to uranus and neptune uranus itself was highly
space_54.txt$monochromatic in appearance one oddity was that its magnetic axis was
space_54.txt$found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational
space_54.txt$axis giving uranus a peculiar magnetosphere icy channels were found on
space_54.txt$ariel and miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains 10
space_54.txt$satellites and one more ring were discovered
space_54.txt$in contrast to uranus neptune was found to have rather active weather
space_54.txt$including numerous cloud features the ring arcs turned out to be bright
