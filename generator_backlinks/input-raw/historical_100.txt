historical_100.txt$before mount vesuvius blanketed pompeii in volcanic ash one locals trash could have easily become anothers building materials as dalya alberge reports for the guardian archaeologists working in the ancient city have found evidence of a recycling program in which pompeiians piled garbage at the citys walls and sorted it for reuse in new projects
historical_100.txt$
historical_100.txt$the researchers led by tulane university archaeologist allison emmerson analyzed soil samples recovered from trash excavated in and around the city the soil on the rubbish varied depending on where it was thrown out cesspits left traces of organic soil while litter dumped in the street or piled up outside of the citys walls was covered in sandy deposits
historical_100.txt$
historical_100.txt$the difference in soil allows us to see whether the garbage had been generated in the place where it was found or gathered from elsewhere to be reused and recycled emmersonset to detail her research in life and death in the roman suburb out next month from oxford university presstells the guardian
historical_100.txt$
historical_100.txt$emmerson and her colleagues found signs of the same sandy soil present in garbage mounds inside of several pompeiian buildings walls these structures cores were made of reused materials ranging from crumbled tiles to amphorae and lumps of mortar and plaster the walls outer surfaces were covered in a layer of plaster that hid the mess of materials found within according to emmerson

historical_100.txt$this evidence suggests the piles outside the walls werent material thats been dumped to get rid of it the archaeologist tells the guardian theyre outside the walls being collected and sorted to be resold inside the walls

historical_100.txt$the teams findings refute a previous theory about the garbage piles origins per a 2012 press release from the university of cincinnati 19thcentury archaeologists suspected the piles represented rubble cleared out of pompeii after an earthquake rattled the city in 62 ad17 years before the volcanic eruption that killed some 2000 of the citys 12000 inhabitants the majority of the mounds were actually removed by archaeologists during the 20th century reports the guardian

historical_100.txt$as i was working outside pompeii i saw that the city extended into developed neighborhoods outside the walls  so it didnt make sense to me that these suburbs were also being used as landfills says emmerson to the guardian
historical_100.txt$
historical_100.txt$emmerson argues that the ancient romans viewed suburban garbage mounds differently than modern humans think of landfills rather than corralling waste in areas far removed from normal life she writes in the abstract for a talk titled another mans treasure the life and afterlife of pompeiis waste these sites developed in the busiest areas of the suburb which could serve as staging grounds for processes of recycling and reuse

historical_100.txt$speaking with the guardian emmerson adds for the most part we dont care what happens to our trash as long as its taken away what ive found in pompeii is an entirely different priority that waste was being collected and sorted for recycling
historical_100.txt$
historical_100.txt$emmersons previous research has shown that residents of pompeii had a much closer relationship with trash than humans today trash littered pompeiis streets and was even found piled inside of and on top of the citys tombs nineteenthcentury archaeologists took these mounds as a sign that the 62 ad earthquake made the city fall into disrepair but emmerson then at the university of cincinnati challenged this view by highlighting evidence suggesting the city was in a period of rejuvenation by 79 ad

historical_100.txt$tombs for example were built not in secluded respectful spaces but in hightraffic parts of the city the goal was to ensure that the deceased would be remembereda strategy that had the unfortunate side effect of placing peoples resting places directly in the path of the citys litterleaving inhabitants

historical_100.txt$per the press release emmerson and her colleagues once excavated a room in which two cesspits filled with animal bones olive pits and other assorted waste stood alongside a cistern or tank used for storing drinking and washing water
historical_100.txt$
historical_100.txt$the pompeiians lived much closer to their garbage than most of us would find acceptable emmerson tells the guardian not because the city lacked infrastructure and they didnt bother to manage trash but because their systems of urban management were organized around different principles
