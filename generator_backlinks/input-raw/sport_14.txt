sport_14.txt$northern ireland man james mcilroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekends spar european indoor championships in madrid
sport_14.txt$the 28yearold has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the 800 metres favourites i believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in sheffield i can run my race from the front back or middle said mcilroy new coach tony lester has helped get mcilroys career back on track the 28yearold 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards mcilroy now lives in windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the nononsense leadership style of former army sergeant lester lester is better known for his work with 400m runners roger black and mark richardson in the past but under his guidance mcilroy has secured five wins this indoor season
sport_14.txt$mcilroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for ireland at the outdoor european championships in 1998 that was my last decent year said mcilroy who temporarily retired last august before returning to the sport under lesters shrewd guidance before every race was like trying to climb mount everest and i now know you cant do it on your own trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing halfdead and terrified on the starting line which became a bit too much mcilroy who was compared to the likes of sebastian coe steve cram and steve ovett in his younger days is now competing without the benefit of national lottery funding that situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the worldclass times he produced in the 800m and 1000m at major races in erfurt and stuttgart earlier this season russian dmitriy bogdanov won at the same madrid venue last week and then claimed the european championship race would be between himself dutchman arnoud okken and antonio reina of spain but mcilroy is unfazed
sport_14.txt$he admitted he looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion i never write myself off and lets face it i havent or looked like being beaten this season and mcilroy whose time of one minute 4668seconds in erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the uk alltime list is also already looking beyond madrid he said ive been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important ultimately of course this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summers world championships that ambition has meant that ive had only two nights out since last august the rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career
