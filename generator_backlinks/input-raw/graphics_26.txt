graphics_26.txt$ps  ive tried it on a speedstar24 and 24x and it works 
graphics_26.txt$not with all software  for instance it doesnt work at all with
graphics_26.txt$animator pro from autodesk it cant detect any svga modes when
graphics_26.txt$running univesa this is really a problem as we need a vesa driver
graphics_26.txt$for both aa pro and some hicolor stuff 
graphics_26.txt$just out of curiosity are you using the latest version 32  versions
graphics_26.txt$previous to this did not fill in all of the capabilities bits and other
graphics_26.txt$information correctly  i had problems with a lot of software until i got
graphics_26.txt$this version  i dont think the author got around to posting an
graphics_26.txt$announcementof it or at least i missed it but 32 was available in the
graphics_26.txt$directory indicated as of 329
graphics_26.txt$i sure did use version 32 it works fine with most software but not
graphics_26.txt$with animator pro and that one is quite important to me pretty
graphics_26.txt$useless program without that thing working imho
graphics_26.txt$so i hope the author can fix that
