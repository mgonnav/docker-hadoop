graphics_98.txt$ in recent years many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a
graphics_98.txt$ new language called postscript  see postscript language by adobe systems
graphics_98.txt$ incorporated isbn  0201101793 co 1985
graphics_98.txt$ so given a line l and a polygon p we can write a postscript program that
graphics_98.txt$ draws the line l and the polygon p and then outputs the answer  by
graphics_98.txt$ output we mean the program executes a command called showpage which
graphics_98.txt$ actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon  a quick
graphics_98.txt$ examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q and
graphics_98.txt$thus
graphics_98.txt$ the original problem
graphics_98.txt$curiously in modern postscript the point in a polygon problem can
graphics_98.txt$be solved even more easily  to wit

graphics_98.txt$ this program will test whether a point is inside a given polygon
graphics_98.txt$ currently it uses the evenodd rule but that can be changed by
graphics_98.txt$ replacing ineofill with infill  these are level 2 operators
graphics_98.txt$ so if youve only got level 1 youre out of luck
graphics_98.txt$ the result will be printed on the output stream
graphics_98.txt$ caution only accurate to device pixels
