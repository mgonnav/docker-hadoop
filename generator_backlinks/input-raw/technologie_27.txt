technologie_27.txt$net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims
technologie_27.txt$the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage however dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster
technologie_27.txt$the link to the website is contained in a spam email that is currently circulating the messages subject line reads urgent tsunami earthquake appeal and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts the web address of the fake site is decukorg which could be close enough to the official wwwdecorguk address to confuse some people keen to donate patricia sanders spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down she said the spam emails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered it is thought that the fake site is being run from romania ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web
technologie_27.txt$dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation bt and decs hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down she said
