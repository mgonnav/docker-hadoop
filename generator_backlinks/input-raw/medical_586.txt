medical_586.txt$poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did
medical_586.txt$not exist  calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i
medical_586.txt$see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well
medical_586.txt$ do you believe that any quacks exist  how about quack diagnoses  is
medical_586.txt$ being a licensed physician enough to guarantee that someone is not
medical_586.txt$ a quack or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack
medical_586.txt$ other people shouldnt say so  can you give an example of a
medical_586.txt$ commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis
medical_586.txt$ or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer
medical_586.txt$ need to worry about unscrupulous healers taking advantage of
medical_586.txt$ people
medical_586.txt$ david rind
medical_586.txt$i dont like the term quack being applied to a licensed physician david
medical_586.txt$questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethicalin my opinion
medical_586.txt$ill give you some examples
medical_586.txt$1 prescribing controlled substances to patients with no
medical_586.txt$demonstrated needother than a drug addition for the medication
medical_586.txt$2 prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid
medical_586.txt$function for the purpose of quick weight loss
medical_586.txt$3 using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has
medical_586.txt$been shown to be ineffective and dangerouscyanide release by
medical_586.txt$the nci
medical_586.txt$these are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should
medical_586.txt$not committ but sometimes do  there are also errors of omissionsome of
medical_586.txt$which result in malpractice suits  i dont think that using antifungal
medical_586.txt$agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be
medical_586.txt$having a problem with candidaor another fungal growth is an error of
medical_586.txt$commission or omission  healers have had a long history of trying to
medical_586.txt$relieve human suffering  some have stuck to standard approved procedures
medical_586.txt$others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a
medical_586.txt$chance that it will help the patient  the key has to be tied to the
medical_586.txt$healers oath i will do no harm  but you know david that very few
medical_586.txt$treatments involve no risk to the patient  the job of the physician is a
medical_586.txt$very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed  each
medical_586.txt$physician deals with this riskbenefit paradox a little differently  some
medical_586.txt$are very conservative while others are more agressive  an agressive
medical_586.txt$approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long
medical_586.txt$as the motive is improving the patients health and not an attempt to rake
medical_586.txt$in lots of moneythrough some of the schemes that have been uncovered in
medical_586.txt$the medicare fraud cases i dont see the need to label these healers as
medical_586.txt$quacks or even unethical
medical_586.txt$what do i reserve the term quack for  pseudomedical professionals
medical_586.txt$these people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the
medical_586.txt$frustrated patient to fall into their lair  some of these individuals are
medical_586.txt$really doing a pretty good job of providing alternative medicine  but
medical_586.txt$many lack any formal training and are in the business simply to make a
medical_586.txt$few fast bucks   while a patient can be reasonably assured of getting
medical_586.txt$competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted this alternative
medical_586.txt$care area is really a buyers beware arena  if you are lucky you may find
medical_586.txt$someone who can help you  if you are unlucky you can loose a lot of
medical_586.txt$money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo
medical_586.txt$medical professional to diagnose diseasewhich is the fortay of the
medical_586.txt$liscened physicians
medical_586.txt$i hope that this clears things up david
