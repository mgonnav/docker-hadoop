space_87.txt$the following are my thoughts on a meeting that i hugh kelso and bob lilly
space_87.txt$had with an aide of sen patty murrays  we were there to discuss ssto and
space_87.txt$commercial space  this is how it went
space_87.txt$after receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of ssto
space_87.txt$i called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local senator d patty
space_87.txt$murray washington state  i started asking for an hour and when i heard
space_87.txt$the gasp on the end of the phone i quickly backed off to 12 an hour
space_87.txt$later in that conversation i learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes
space_87.txt$we got the standard bozo treatment  that is we were called back by an aide
space_87.txt$who scheduled a meeting with us in order to determine that we were not
space_87.txt$bozos and to familiarize himself with the material and to screen it to
space_87.txt$make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material
space_87.txt$well i got allocated 12 hour with sen murrays aide and we ended up talking
space_87.txt$to him for 45 minutes with us ending the meeting and him still listening
space_87.txt$we covered a lot of ground and only a little tiny bit was dcx specific
space_87.txt$most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer  there was another
space_87.txt$woman there who took copius quantities of notes on every topic that
space_87.txt$we brought up
space_87.txt$but with murray being new we wanted to entrench ourselves as noncorporate
space_87.txt$aligned ie not speaking for boeing local citizens interentested in space
space_87.txt$so we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to
space_87.txt$leo  solar power satellites are a big focus here so we hit them as becoming
space_87.txt$feasible with lower cost access and we hit the environmental stand on that
space_87.txt$we hit the tourism angle and i left a copy of the patric collins tourism
space_87.txt$paper with side notes being that everyone who goes into space and sees the
space_87.txt$atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist esp after seeing the smog
space_87.txt$over la  we hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification which is
space_87.txt$more pronounced in space and said that that had potential to lead to
space_87.txt$understanding of and maybe a cure for osteoporosis  we hit the education
space_87.txt$whereby kids get enthused by space but as they get older and find out that
space_87.txt$they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there they go on to other
space_87.txt$fields with low cost to orbit the chances they might get there someday
space_87.txt$would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed
space_87.txt$we hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business
space_87.txt$angle  we hit the lower cost of satellite launches gps navigation personal
space_87.txt$communicators tellecommunications new services etc  jobs provided
space_87.txt$in those sectors
space_87.txt$jobs provided building the thing balance of trade improvement etc
space_87.txt$we mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs
space_87.txt$we left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order
space_87.txt$to make this even easier to do  and he asked questions on this point
space_87.txt$we ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are
space_87.txt$proceeding in this area and that we want to make sure that the
space_87.txt$results from these efforts are not lost much like condor or majellan
space_87.txt$and most importantly we asked that she help fund further efforts along
space_87.txt$the lines of lowering the cost to leo
space_87.txt$in the middle we also gave a little speal about the lunar resource data
space_87.txt$purchase act and the guy filed it separately he was very interested in it
space_87.txt$he asked some questions about it and seemed like he wanted to jump on it
space_87.txt$and contact some of the people involved with it so something may actually
space_87.txt$happen immediatly there
space_87.txt$the last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we
space_87.txt$knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town and that they
space_87.txt$could feel free to call us any time with questions and if we didnt know
space_87.txt$the answers that we would see to it that they questions got to people who
space_87.txt$really did know the answers
space_87.txt$then finally we asked for an appointment with the senator herself  he
space_87.txt$said that we would get on the list and he also said that knowing her this
space_87.txt$would be something that she would be very interested in although they
space_87.txt$do have a time problem getting her scheduled since she is only in the
space_87.txt$state 1 week out of 6 these days
space_87.txt$all in all we felt like we did a pretty good job
space_87.txt$john
