technologie_94.txt$the battle of the premium allwheel drive sedans heats up with the debut of acuras updated tlx
technologie_94.txt$the acura tlx certainly has its fans but over the years it and its predecessors have struggled for legitimacy against the established premium european competition the new 2021 tlx that officially debuted thursday aims to change that with sharp physicality and a promising pair of turbocharged engine options lets see how acuras new sport sedan stacks up against the premium competition
technologie_94.txt$the usual suspects are here audis newly announced 2021 a4 the bmw 330i the mercedesbenz c300 and were also including the volvo s60 another underdog in this class like the audi and the volvo the 2021 tlx features standard frontwheel drive the bimmer and benz send their power to the rear all five sedans are available with optional allwheeldrive so well be looking at those configurations to level the playing field
technologie_94.txt$powertrain
technologie_94.txt$the upcoming tlx type s is certainly exciting with its 30liter turbo v6 but acura hasnt yet announced details or specs for that model so well have to circle back on that comparo later for now lets focus on the standard powertrain a 20liter turbocharged fourcylinder mated to a 10speed automatic transmission this is the same vtec turbo engine found in acuras rdx crossover with 272 horsepower and 280 poundfeet of torque in this presumably lighter chassis it should feel more responsive
technologie_94.txt$the tlx claims the highest horsepower in its core competitive set according to acura and technically thats true the a4 3 series and c300 are all members of the around250horsepower club however for this allwheeldrive comparison we have to look at the volvo s60 t6 awd which  with its supercharged and turbocharged engine  raises the bar to 316 ponies if youre feeling the need for speed maybe check out the swede
technologie_94.txt$acura has not stated fuel economy estimates for the newgeneration tlx but we can make an educated guess based on the rdxs numbers the crossover is good for 21 city 27 highway and 23 combined miles per gallon in the sedans presumably lighter chassis we should expect slightly better numbers
technologie_94.txt$itll need that extra efficiency to ascend from its previous spot near the bottom of the pile the volvo s60 the most powerful of the bunch is for now the least efficient competitor with 21 city mpg 32 highway mpg and 25 mpg combined  still better than the 2019 tlx slightly better is the mercedesbenz c300 at 26 combined mpg audi hasnt released numbers for its 2021 a4 but we dont think itll be too far off of the 2020 models 27 combined mpg
technologie_94.txt$the current king of the hill is the bmw 330i xdrive at 25 city 34 highway and 28 combined mpg frankly we dont think the acura will beat that but if the tlx manages to land in the middle of the pack itll still be a solid step up over last year
technologie_94.txt$the tlxs new look  based on the type s concept  is wrapped around a new platform that is longer and wider than before the wheelbase also stretches to 1130 inches a gain of 37 inches interestingly the roof sits 06inch lower 564 than last year which contributes to the wide and low look
technologie_94.txt$the tlx is now the longest model in this roundup measuring over 7 inches longer than the next longest audi a4 and over 10 inches longer than the cclass the acuras 113inch wheelbase is also one of the longest in the class acuras tlx has long straddled the size spectrum between these compact sedans and their midsize counterparts
technologie_94.txt$with 135 cubic feet of trunk space the tlx lands right in the middle of the pack the bmw has the biggest boot in the bunch at 17 cubic feet while s60 drivers make do with just 116 cubes interestingly the volvo is the broadest sedan at 803 inches  about 5 inches wider than the acura  if wide bois are a thing youre into
