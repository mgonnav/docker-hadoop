space_77.txt$a friend of mine and i were wondering where the expression pushing
space_77.txt$the envelope comes from  anyone out there know
space_77.txt$every aircraft has flight constraints for speedaoapower  when
space_77.txt$graphed these define the flight envelope of that aircraft
space_77.txt$presumably so named because the graphed line encloses envelopes the
space_77.txt$area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft
space_77.txt$doesnt fall out of the sky  hence pushing the envelope becomes
space_77.txt$operating at or beyond the edge of the flight or operational
space_77.txt$envelope
space_77.txt$note that the envelope isnt precisely known until someone actually
space_77.txt$flies the airplane in those regions  up to that point all there are
space_77.txt$are the theoretical predictions  hence one of the things test pilots
space_77.txt$do for a living is push the envelope to find out how close the
space_77.txt$correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is  in
space_77.txt$essence pushing back the edges of the theoretical envelope to where
space_77.txt$the airplane actually starts to fail to fly  note too that this is
space_77.txt$done is a quite calculated and careful way flight tests are generally
space_77.txt$carefully coreographed and just what is going to be pushed and how
space_77.txt$far is precisely planned despite occasional deviations from plans
space_77.txt$such as the early first flight of the f16 during its highspeed
space_77.txt$taxi tests
space_77.txt$im sure mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about
space_77.txt$this process and then some
space_77.txt$insisting on perfect safety is for people who dont have the balls to live
space_77.txt$in the real world    mary shafer nasa ames dryden
