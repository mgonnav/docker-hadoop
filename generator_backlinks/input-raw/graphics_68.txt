graphics_68.txt$among all of the design agencies headaches artwork proofing is probably one of the most acute ones forwarding countless numbers of requests following up your approvers with reminders that they have a file to check searching for their feedback in the endless pile of emails or messages quite daunting to say the least and quite expensive too  the amounts of time and as a result money spent on this backandforth game are quite significant however there is a solution that would allow you to cut your turnaround time by up to 35  a specialized proofing software
graphics_68.txt$one of such programs is approval studio it is a proofing tool developed specifically to help designers and creative teams spend less time on boring and repetitive processes and make the whole workflow more organized and efficient there are quite a few features with which approval studio helps you to streamline proofing of visual assets so lets create a project upload some file and see what we can do with it
graphics_68.txt$1 sharing files
graphics_68.txt$after the upload users can start sharing their artwork with other reviewers there are two types of reviewers internal  they can access your dashboard or even get tasks assigned to them in approvals pro version  and external ones lets concentrate on the latter
graphics_68.txt$a big blue share button in the upper right corner is the starting point of your cooperation with the clients you can send the invitation to approval studio to their email or share a short link via your messenger chat  with a password or making the file readonly if you like your reviewer will be able to see the same thing you see and add annotations
graphics_68.txt$2 online review tool
graphics_68.txt$approval studio offers advanced annotation possibilities that include a set of different shapes namely a point a circle a square and a freeform if you need to draw something by hand users can pick a color for each annotation which is helpful when there are several reviewers also there is a possibility to bind one annotation to several places in the artwork if there is the same repeated mistake or if you need to apply similar changes lets say to the fonts or colors annotations will appear on the mockup itself and on the comments panel to the right
graphics_68.txt$if you need to check the artwork from another angle or annotate a much smaller detail it is not a problem at all approval studio allows rotating the image as much as you like and zooms it without descaling or quality loss so that you can read even the tiniest text
graphics_68.txt$the main thing is that the system is totally live  whenever they add a comment you will see it instantly on your screen with no need to refresh the page it works like a builtin messenger to make your review sessions more convenient
graphics_68.txt$after the discussion is over the last thing thats left is approving or rejecting the file at this stage its important to be careful because you will not be able to add any new annotations to this version after you confirm your verdict
