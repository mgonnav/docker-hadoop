technologie_8.txt$security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card
technologie_8.txt$the zafid virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected email antivirus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online antivirus firm sophos said that 10 of the email currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus
technologie_8.txt$like many other windows viruses zafid plunders microsoft outlook for email addresses and then uses mailsending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug the attachment on the email poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces
technologie_8.txt$the virus subject line says merry christmas and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the email address the infected message has been sent to the message in the body of the email reads happy holidays and this too is translated on infected machines the virus tries to disable antivirus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america italy spain bulgaria and hungary the original zafi virus appeared in april this year we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards and we recommend this to all our clients too said mikko hypponen who heads fsecures antivirus team
