space_27.txt$is finding vendors who can supply mid1960s vintage hardware like
space_27.txt$guidance system components and the fact that the launch pads and vab

space_27.txt$the atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the

space_27.txt$nasagiss charlie jackman and anne douglass nasagoddard space
space_27.txt$flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and
space_27.txt$environmental research inc  the effort was to look at the effects
space_27.txt$of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere
space_27.txt$the following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine
space_27.txt$industrial sources    300000000 kilogramsyear
space_27.txt$natural sources     75000000 kilogramsyear
space_27.txt$shuttle sources	  725000 kilogramsyear
space_27.txt$the shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 titan rockets are
space_27.txt$launched yearly thus the launches would add less than 025 to the
space_27.txt$total stratospheric chlorine sources
space_27.txt$the effect on ozone is minimal  global yearly average total ozone would
space_27.txt$be decreased by 00065 this is much less than total ozone variability
space_27.txt$associated with volcanic activity and solar flares
space_27.txt$the influence of humanmade chlorine products on ozone is computed
space_27.txt$by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1 decrease in globally
space_27.txt$averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990 the influence of the space shuttle and
space_27.txt$titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible  the launch
space_27.txt$schedule of the space shuttle and titan rockets would need to be
space_27.txt$increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about
space_27.txt$the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons

space_27.txt$the challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion this is
space_27.txt$a welldocumented fact see the rogers commission report for example
space_27.txt$what looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank
space_27.txt$came apart the forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the
space_27.txt$astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the kerwin

space_27.txt$the astronauts were killed when the moreorless intact cabin hit the

space_27.txt$examined them they were sent off to be buried
space_27.txt$you cant use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit
space_27.txt$because it cant get there it is big and heavy and does not carry
space_27.txt$enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks
space_27.txt$furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of
space_27.txt$that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in
space_27.txt$the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter is highly
space_27.txt$specialized for travel between earths surface and low orbit taking it
space_27.txt$higher is enormously costly and wasteful a much better approach would
