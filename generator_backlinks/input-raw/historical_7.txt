historical_7.txt$the site shows a nearcontinuous record of plant and animal life over a period of one million years following the kpg mass extinction according to science lyson and his team were able to determine the age of the site through volcanic ash layers with radioactive minerals along with the presence of many fern fossils which thrive after an ecosystem has been disturbed

historical_7.txt$the researchers found that plants and animals rebounded faster than previously thought and that when ferns were replaced by palm forests the variety of plants also sparked diversification of mammals from small ratsized animals to larger ones by 700000 years after the extinction event some mammals were 100 times bigger than ones that had lived through the asteroid impact
