medical_424.txt$ive recently listened to a tape by dr stanislaw burzynski in which he
medical_424.txt$claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti
medical_424.txt$cancer properties that he names antineoplastons  burzynski says that his
medical_424.txt$work has met with hostility in the united states despite the favorable
medical_424.txt$responses of his subjects during clinical trials
medical_424.txt$what is the generally accepted opinion of dr burzynskis research  he
medical_424.txt$paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an
medical_424.txt$intolerant medical establishment but i have no basis from which to judge
medical_424.txt$his claims  two weeks ago however i read that the nihs department of
medical_424.txt$alternative medicine has decided to focus their attention on burzynskis
medical_424.txt$work  their budget is so small that i imagine they wouldnt investigate a
medical_424.txt$treatment that didnt seem promising
medical_424.txt$any opinions on burzynskis antineoplastons or information about the current
medical_424.txt$status of his research would be appreciated
