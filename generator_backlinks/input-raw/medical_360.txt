medical_360.txt$ i am not a researcher or a medical person but it amazes me that
medical_360.txt$ when they cant find a scientific or a known fact they automatically
medical_360.txt$ assume that the reaction is psychological  it is mind boggling
medical_360.txt$this simply stated is a result of the bankrupt ethics in
medical_360.txt$the healthcare and scientific medicine industries
medical_360.txt$america is fed up with the massive waste and fraud that is costing
medical_360.txt$us 15 of our gnp to support these industries while delivering
medical_360.txt$marginal health care to the community
medical_360.txt$unfortunately the clinton plan in whatever form it
medical_360.txt$takes will probably cost us an even greater sum  bleah
