medical_564.txt$  a friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of crohns
medical_564.txt$  disease
medical_564.txt$  but she cant seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables
medical_564.txt$  without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence
medical_564.txt$  her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
medical_564.txt$  problems of people with crohns disease 
medical_564.txt$  i saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric
medical_564.txt$  thanks in advance

medical_564.txt$ all your friend really has to do is find a registered dieticianrd  while
medical_564.txt$ most work in hospitals and clinics many major cities will have rds who
medical_564.txt$ are in private practice so to speak  many physicans will refer their
medical_564.txt$ patients with crohns disease to rds for dietary help  if you can get
medical_564.txt$ your friends physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for
medical_564.txt$ the rds services just like the services of a physical therapist  the
medical_564.txt$ better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friends
medical_564.txt$ plan doesnt it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to
medical_564.txt$ control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal
medical_564.txt$ crohns disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and
medical_564.txt$ lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but
medical_564.txt$ im not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors  for
medical_564.txt$ bad inflammation steroids are used but for a mild case the side effects
medical_564.txt$ are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use  upjohn is developing
medical_564.txt$ a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with
medical_564.txt$ inflammatory diseases but its not available yet
medical_564.txt$ marty b
medical_564.txt$be sure a dietician is up to date on crohns and ulcerative colitis
medical_564.txt$previously low residue diets were recommended but this advice has
medical_564.txt$now changed  also there will be differences in advice in patients with
medical_564.txt$and without obstructuon remaining so input by the physician will be
medical_564.txt$important  i find the dietician very important in my practice and
medical_564.txt$i send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeing
medical_564.txt$them since dieticians know so much better how to get diet histories
medical_564.txt$and evaluate the contents of a diet than i do
