space_13.txt$ dont forget the galilean satellites of jupiter
space_13.txt$my poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny

space_13.txt$jupiter is 2e27 kg while the galilean satellites are around 1e23
space_13.txt$also as i said the few references that ive looked at do not
space_13.txt$mention outgassing or breakup as important processes  the important
space_13.txt$thing is a jupitersuncomet reverse slingshot that leads to a
