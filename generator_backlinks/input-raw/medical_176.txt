medical_176.txt$i love the faq
medical_176.txt$the comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining
medical_176.txt$correction after rk and possibly after prk is interresting  why is
medical_176.txt$this  does anyone know for sure whether this applies to prk as well
medical_176.txt$also why is it possible to get a correction in prk with involvement of
medical_176.txt$only about 5 of the corneal depth while rk is done to a depth of up to
medical_176.txt$95  why such a difference  i thought the proceedures were simmilar
medical_176.txt$with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in prk  i must not
medical_176.txt$be understanding all of the differences
medical_176.txt$in the faq the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than
medical_176.txt$with glasses alone  if this is completly attributable to the
medical_176.txt$intentional slight undercorrection then it can be compensated for when
medical_176.txt$necessary with glasses or contacts if they can be worn afterall  it
medical_176.txt$is important to know if that is not the case however and some other
medical_176.txt$consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision  the
medical_176.txt$first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense which
medical_176.txt$glasses couldnt help
medical_176.txt$would not help
