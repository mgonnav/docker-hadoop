medical_542.txt$ a friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of crohns
medical_542.txt$ disease
medical_542.txt$ but she cant seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables
medical_542.txt$ without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence
medical_542.txt$ her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
medical_542.txt$ problems of people with crohns disease 
medical_542.txt$ i saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric
medical_542.txt$ thanks in advance

medical_542.txt$all your friend really has to do is find a registered dieticianrd  while
medical_542.txt$most work in hospitals and clinics many major cities will have rds who
medical_542.txt$are in private practice so to speak  many physicans will refer their
medical_542.txt$patients with crohns disease to rds for dietary help  if you can get
medical_542.txt$your friends physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for
medical_542.txt$the rds services just like the services of a physical therapist  the
medical_542.txt$better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friends
medical_542.txt$plan doesnt it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to
medical_542.txt$control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal
medical_542.txt$crohns disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and
medical_542.txt$lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but
medical_542.txt$im not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors  for
medical_542.txt$bad inflammation steroids are used but for a mild case the side effects
medical_542.txt$are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use  upjohn is developing
medical_542.txt$a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with
medical_542.txt$inflammatory diseases but its not available yet
