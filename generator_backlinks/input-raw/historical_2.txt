historical_2.txt$timgad
historical_2.txt$rather grandly titled the pompeii of africa and unesco world heritage recognized timgad is a fantastic example of a roman colonial town that is a regularly recommended algerian tourist attraction set in the lush hills of the northern aurès mountains some of the must see points of interest at this fascinating sight include the trajan arch which was restored at some point in the second century and the capitoline temple the latter is dedicated to jupiter and is approximately the same size as the pantheon in rome to give you some impression of the grandeur of this place it is also one of the best examples of the logistics of roman town planning if thats the kind of thing that floats your boat

historical_2.txt$qala of beni hammad
historical_2.txt$moving briefly away from roman ruins the qala of beni hammad was in the 11th century the first capital city of the hammadid rulers not much survives of this fortified city however the little that does is an intriguing insight into what life may have been like before the abandonment of it in 1900 due to the threat of a hilalian invasion officially recognised by unesco in 1980 this archaeological site is set at a height of 1000m above sea level and is surrounded by an impressively beautiful mountainous setting as one of the most precisely dated complexes of the islamic civilization the qala of beni hammad is also home to the second oldest minaret in the country and a testament to the past palatial culture of north africa

historical_2.txt$tipaza
historical_2.txt$previously known as tipasa this is another of algerias most famed roman ruins and with good reason constructed on three small hills overlooking the ocean it was a small tradingpost of much commercial but little cultural importance in roman algeria however this cultural unimportance has long since been banished to the past as tipaza boasts a unique amalgamation of phoenician roman palaeochristian and byzantine ruins alongside indigenous monuments this is according to the unesco world heritage site website to which tipaza was inaugurated in 1982 aside from all this historical interest the pristine mediterranean beach location doesnt hurt either

historical_2.txt$lambaesis
historical_2.txt$among some of the most interesting and perhaps lesserknown ruins in northern africa we have the roman ruin of lambaesis situated next to the modern village of tazoult similarly to timgad it is located in the aurès mountains and is also home to arches baths and even aqueducts however this garrison town is well worth a visit for the gem that is the praetorium of the third augustan legion alone this commandants house dates from around 268 and dominates the site of the modern day ruins of lambaesis which was once the capital of the roman province numidia

historical_2.txt$tiddis
historical_2.txt$one of algerias most beautiful and wellpreserved roman archaeological sites the roman town of tiddis is a rarely visited spot by travelers making it one of the countrys coolest ruins to check out tiny in size but grand in history tiddis is also the home to a temple of mithra the ancient persian god of light and wisdom cisterns and archways and is very close to the visually stunning city of bridges constantine however unlike many roman towns tiddis is unusual for its use of winding pathways that climb the steep hillsides on which it is set archaeologists believe this to be because the site was originally a berber settlement that was occupied and developed by the romans during the first century

historical_2.txt$tlemcen national park
historical_2.txt$to round off the list we move to tlemcen the town of cherries this national park is a recent addition to the national parks of algeria but it is one of the best as it includes not only expansive forests cliffs and waterfalls but also several archaeological sites most notably that of mansoura mansoura was the ancient city upon which the modern town of tlemcen was built and its well worth checking out the 13thcentury ruins of this enormous ancient mosque are really imposing giving you some sense of life in the ancient world and a remarkable introduction to the architectural magnificence of it if mansoura doesnt interest you though the mausoleum of sidi boumediene a 12thcentury sufi leader is also situated within tlemcen national park
