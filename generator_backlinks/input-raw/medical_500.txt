medical_500.txt$ive recently listened to a tape by dr stanislaw burzynski in which he
medical_500.txt$claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti
medical_500.txt$cancer properties that he names antineoplastons  burzynski says that his
medical_500.txt$work has met with hostility in the united states despite the favorable
medical_500.txt$responses of his subjects during clinical trials
medical_500.txt$what is the generally accepted opinion of dr burzynskis research  he
medical_500.txt$paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an
medical_500.txt$intolerant medical establishment but i have no basis from which to judge
medical_500.txt$his claims  two weeks ago however i read that the nihs department of
medical_500.txt$alternative medicine has decided to focus their attention on burzynskis
medical_500.txt$work  their budget is so small that i imagine they wouldnt investigate a
medical_500.txt$treatment that didnt seem promising
medical_500.txt$any opinions on burzynskis antineoplastons or information about the current
medical_500.txt$status of his research would be appreciated

medical_500.txt$theres been extensive discussion on the compuserve cancer forum about dr
medical_500.txt$burzynskis treatment as a result of the decision of a forum members father
medical_500.txt$to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma  this disease is
medical_500.txt$universally and usually rapidly fatal  after diagnosis in june 1992 the
medical_500.txt$tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy  the forum
medical_500.txt$member checked extensively on dr burzynkis track record for this disease
medical_500.txt$he spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from
medical_500.txt$glioblastoma following this treatment and to an nci oncologist who had
medical_500.txt$audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive
medical_500.txt$after the forum members father began dr burzynskis treatment in
medical_500.txt$september all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his
medical_500.txt$oncologist in chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of
medical_500.txt$shrinkage or necrosis
medical_500.txt$the patients oncologist although telling him he would probably not live
medical_500.txt$past december 1992 was vehemently opposed to his trying dr burzynskis
medical_500.txt$treatment  since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under dr burzynskis
medical_500.txt$treatment shes since changed her attitude toward continuing these
medical_500.txt$treatments saying if it aint broke dont fix it
medical_500.txt$dr burzynski is an md phd with a research background who found a
medical_500.txt$protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients synthesized it
medical_500.txt$and administers it to patients with certain cancer types  there is little
medical_500.txt$understanding of the actual mechanism of activity
