space_86.txt$mariatta boeing mcdonell douglas general dynamics lockheed rockwell
space_86.txt$getting together and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market
space_86.txt$price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles and spending say
space_86.txt$3million to do that  recognizing that most of the military requirements
space_86.txt$for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere say has the shuttle
space_86.txt$ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability  you get the idea figure
space_86.txt$out how many how often where to etc
space_86.txt$then taking this data and forming a sematech type company bad example i
space_86.txt$know but at least its an example  to develop between 3 and 5 craft
space_86.txt$designs  then to take all of those designs and figure out exactly what
space_86.txt$the technologies are and demonstrate those technologies in order to
space_86.txt$eliminate designs that cant be built today  and lets say that this
space_86.txt$portion again funded by the gov cost about 20 million
space_86.txt$and from here all of these companies went their separate ways with the
space_86.txt$intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall
space_86.txt$street and saying i want to build this vehicle and here are the numbers
space_86.txt$that show 20 roi fund me
space_86.txt$now many of you think that this is a joke but i have it on good authority that
space_86.txt$just this project is shaping up in the background it seems that the aerospace

space_86.txt$als dcy etc  they need to work more in the japaneese and european
space_86.txt$spirit of initial cooperation  they have also learned that design requirements
space_86.txt$that are phony ie some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be
space_86.txt$ends up getting chopped up in congress because it is not a real requirement
space_86.txt$any feedback
