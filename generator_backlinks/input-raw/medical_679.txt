medical_679.txt$to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics
medical_679.txt$i guess im still not clear on what the term candida bloom means
medical_679.txt$but certainly it is well known that thrush superficial candidal
medical_679.txt$infections on mucous membranes can occur after antibiotic use
medical_679.txt$this has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack
medical_679.txt$diagnosis that has been being discussed
medical_679.txt$found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida  women have been known

medical_679.txt$lucky how  since a recent article randomized controlled trial of
medical_679.txt$oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis ive mentioned to a

medical_679.txt$again this just isnt what the systemic yeast syndrome is about and
medical_679.txt$has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed
medical_679.txt$there is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the gi tract with
medical_679.txt$bacteria after antibiotic therapy dont seem to be very helpful in
medical_679.txt$reducing diarrhea but i dont think anyone would view this as a
medical_679.txt$quack therapy
