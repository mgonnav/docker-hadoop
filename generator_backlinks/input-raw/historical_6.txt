historical_6.txt$despite the long history of mummy scanning brown says that many questions remain about ancient mortuary practice that cant be answered with individual scans he points to archives being developed at the penn museum and the impact mummy database which compile scans of mummies and offer access to researchers who wish to study them as steps toward improving our understanding of both the mummification process and its artifacts
