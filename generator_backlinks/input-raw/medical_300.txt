medical_300.txt$   practitioners twice the success rate of conventional medicine
medical_300.txt$1 90 of diseases is not the same thing as 90 of patients
medical_300.txt$in a world with one curable disease that strikes 100 people and nine
medical_300.txt$incurable diseases which strikes one person each medical science will cure
medical_300.txt$91 of the patients and report that 90 of diseases have no therapy
medical_300.txt$2 a disease would be counted among the 90 untreatable if nothing better than
