graphics_97.txt$sorry i missed you raymond i was just out in dahlgren last month
graphics_97.txt$im the virtual reality market manager for silicon graphics so perhaps i
graphics_97.txt$can help a little

graphics_97.txt$ hello the real reality our agency started to express interest in
graphics_97.txt$ virtual realityvr  so far we do not know much about vr  all we
graphics_97.txt$ know about are the hollywood movies the terminater 2 and lawnmover
graphics_97.txt$ man  we also know something about vr from abc news magazine and
graphics_97.txt$ computer graphics world magazine
graphics_97.txt$unfortunately while sgi systems were used to create the special effects
graphics_97.txt$for both terminator 2 and lawnmower man those are filmquality computer
graphics_97.txt$graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time  each
graphics_97.txt$frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on
graphics_97.txt$highend parallel processing computer systems thus that level of graphics
graphics_97.txt$would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time 30 frames
graphics_97.txt$per second
graphics_97.txt$ we certainly want to know more about vr  who are the leading
graphics_97.txt$ companies
graphics_97.txt$ agencies universities  what machines support vr ie sgi sun4
graphics_97.txt$ hp9000 bim6000 etc
graphics_97.txt$it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is
graphics_97.txt$true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual
graphics_97.txt$databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second  this
graphics_97.txt$is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot
graphics_97.txt$training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of
graphics_97.txt$the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion
graphics_97.txt$of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous  thus the graphics system
graphics_97.txt$must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex
graphics_97.txt$data representations
graphics_97.txt$additionally the frame rate must be constant  if the system renders 15
graphics_97.txt$frames per second at one point then 60 frames per second the next perhaps
graphics_97.txt$due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was
graphics_97.txt$visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the
graphics_97.txt$graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant
graphics_97.txt$frame rate the system must be able to run in realtime  unix in general
graphics_97.txt$does not support realtime operation but silicon graphics has modified the
graphics_97.txt$unix kernel for its multiprocessor systems to be able to support realtime
graphics_97.txt$operation bypassing the usual unix process prioritymanagement schemes
graphics_97.txt$uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support realtime
graphics_97.txt$operation not sun sparc10 not hp 700 series systems not ibm rs6000 not
graphics_97.txt$even sgis uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our
graphics_97.txt$multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support realtime operation due
graphics_97.txt$to their symmetric multiprocessing smp sharedmemory architecture
graphics_97.txt$from a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments
graphics_97.txt$requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and realtime
graphics_97.txt$multisample antialiasing  of all of the general purpose graphics systems
graphics_97.txt$on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine2
graphics_97.txt$systems fully support these capabilities the antialiasing is particularly
graphics_97.txt$important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an
graphics_97.txt$unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment
graphics_97.txt$  what kind of graphics languages are used with vr
graphics_97.txt$ gl opengl phigs pex gks etc
graphics_97.txt$you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop
graphics_97.txt$vr applications but that is starting at a pretty low level there are
graphics_97.txt$offthe shelf software packages available to get you going much faster
graphics_97.txt$being targeted directly at the vr application developer some of the most
