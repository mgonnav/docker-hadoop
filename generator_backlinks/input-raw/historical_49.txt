historical_49.txt$the german conquest of poland in september 1939 was the first demonstration in war of the new theory of highspeed armoured warfare that had been adopted by the germans when their rearmament began poland was a country all too well suited for such a demonstration its frontiers were immensely longabout 3500 miles in all and the stretch of 1250 miles adjoining german territory had recently been extended to 1750 miles in all by the german occupation of bohemiamoravia and of slovakia so that polands southern flank became exposed to invasionas the northern flank facing east prussia already was western poland had become a huge salient that lay between germanys jaws

historical_49.txt$it would have been wiser for the polish army to assemble farther back behind the natural defense line formed by the vistula and san rivers but that would have entailed the abandonment of some of the most valuable western parts of the country including the silesian coalfields and most of the main industrial zone which lay west of the river barrier the economic argument for delaying the german approach to the main industrial zone was heavily reinforced by polish national pride and military overconfidence
