medical_329.txt$ is there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in a
medical_329.txt$ medicine that heshe sees improvement where the is none or sees
medical_329.txt$ more improvement than there is  if so what is this effect
medical_329.txt$ called  is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctor
medical_329.txt$ doesnt believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement than
medical_329.txt$ there is  what would this effect be called  have these effects
medical_329.txt$ ever been studied  how common are these effects  thank you in
medical_329.txt$ advance for all replies
medical_329.txt$these effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new
medical_329.txt$treatments  researchers try to limit this kind of effect by
medical_329.txt$performing studies that are blind in various ways  some of these
medical_329.txt$are
medical_329.txt$o  the subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a
medical_329.txt$placebo or the test treatment ie whether they are in the
medical_329.txt$control group or the test group
medical_329.txt$o  those administering the treatment do not know which subjects
medical_329.txt$receive a placebo or the test treatment
medical_329.txt$o  those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects
medical_329.txt$receive a placebo or the test treatment
medical_329.txt$obviously at the point at which the data is analyzed one has to
medical_329.txt$differentiate the test group from the control group  but the analysis
medical_329.txt$is quasipublic the researcher describes it and presents the data on
medical_329.txt$which it is based so that others can verify it
medical_329.txt$it is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are
medical_329.txt$animals such as mice there were many cases of skewed results because
medical_329.txt$those who performed the study did not blind themselves  it is not
medical_329.txt$considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already
medical_329.txt$are though it is important that in all respects except the one tested
medical_329.txt$the control and test groups are treated alike
