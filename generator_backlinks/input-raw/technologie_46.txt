technologie_46.txt$researchers from monash swinburne and rmit universities have successfully tested and recorded australias fastest internet data speed and that of the world from a single optical chip  capable of downloading 1000 high definition movies in a split second
technologie_46.txt$published in the prestigious journal nature communications these findings have the potential to not only fasttrack the next 25 years of australias telecommunications capacity but also the possibility for this homegrown technology to be rolled out across the world
technologie_46.txt$this technology has the capacity to support the highspeed internet connections of 18 million households in melbourne australia at the same time and billions across the world during peak periods
technologie_46.txt$they used a new device that replaces 80 lasers with one single piece of equipment known as a microcomb which is smaller and lighter than existing telecommunications hardware it was planted into and loadtested using existing infrastructure which mirrors that used by the nbn
technologie_46.txt$it is the first time any microcomb has been used in a field trial and possesses the highest amount of data produced from a single optical chip
technologie_46.txt$were currently getting a sneakpeak of how the infrastructure for the internet will hold up in two to three years time due to the unprecedented number of people using the internet for remote work socializing and streaming its really showing us that we need to be able to scale the capacity of our internet connections said dr bill corcoran colead author of the study and lecturer in electrical and computer systems engineering at monash university
technologie_46.txt$what our research demonstrates is the ability for fibers that we already have in the ground thanks to the nbn project to be the backbone of communications networks now and in the future weve developed something that is scalable to meet future needs
