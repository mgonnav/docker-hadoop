space_1.txt$can only exist relative to something noncurved  bruce replied
space_1.txt$existence is undefined unless it is synonymous with observable in
space_1.txt$physics  we cannot observe more than the four dimensions we know about
space_1.txt$at the moment i dont see a way to defend that statement and the
space_1.txt$existence of these unobservable phenomena simultaneously  tom
space_1.txt$i hold that space cannot be curved for the simple reason that it can have
space_1.txt$no properties
space_1.txt$of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the
space_1.txt$space to say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved
space_1.txt$is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing i
