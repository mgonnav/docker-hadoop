historical_42.txt$the final offensive on the western front
historical_42.txt$it was eventually agreed among the allied commanders that pershings american troops should advance across the difficult terrain of the argonne forest so that the combined allied offensive would consist of converging attacks against the whole german position west of a line drawn from ypres to verdun thus the americans from the front northwest of verdun and the french from eastern champagne the former on the west bank of the meuse the latter west of the argonne forest were to launch attacks on september 26 with mézières as their objective in order to threaten not only the germans supply line along the mézièressedanmontmédy railway and the natural line of retreat across lorraine but also the hinge of the antwerpmeuse defensive line that the germans were now preparing the british were to attack the hindenburg line between cambrai and saintquentin on september 27 and to try to reach the key rail junction of maubeuge so as to threaten the germans line of retreat through the liège gap the belgians with allied support were to begin a drive from ypres toward ghent on september 28

historical_42.txt$the americans took vauquois and montfaucon in the first two days of their offensive but were soon slowed down and on october 14 when their attack was suspended they had only reached grandpré less than halfway to mézières the french advance meanwhile was halted on the aisne the british though they had broken through the german defenses by october 5 and thenceforward had open country in front of them could not pursue the germans fast enough to endanger their withdrawal nevertheless the piercing of the hindenburg line unnerved the german supreme command the belgians were in possession of all the heights around ypres by september 30

historical_42.txt$georg von hertling who had taken the place of michaelis as germanys chancellor in november 1917 but had proved no more capable than he of restraining ludendorff and hindenburg tendered his resignation on sept 29 1918 the day of the bulgarian armistice and of the major development of the british attack on the western front pending the appointment of a new chancellor ludendorff and hindenburg obtained the emperors consent to an immediate peace move on october 1 they even disclosed their despondency to a meeting of the leaders of all the national political parties thus undermining the german home front by a sudden revelation of facts long hidden from the public and its civilian leaders this new and bleak honesty about germanys deteriorating military situation gave an immense impetus to the native german forces of pacifism and internal discord on october 3 the new chancellor was appointed he was prince maximilian of baden internationally known for his moderation and honorability though max demanded a few days interval lest germanys overture for peace should appear too obviously an admission of imminent collapse the military leaders insisted on an immediate move a german note to wilson requesting an armistice and negotiations on the basis of wilsons own pronouncements was sent off in the night of october 34
historical_42.txt$
historical_42.txt$the us answer of october 8 required germanys preliminary assent 1 to negotiations on the sole question of the means of putting wilsons principles into practice and 2 to the withdrawal of german forces from allied soil the german governments note of october 12 accepted these requirements and suggested a mixed commission to arrange the postulated evacuation on october 14 however the us government sent a second note which coupled allusions to germanys illegal and inhuman methods of warfare with demands that the conditions of the armistice and of the evacuation be determined unilaterally by its own and the allies military advisers and that the arbitrary power of the german regime be removed in order that the forthcoming negotiations could be conducted with a government representative of the german people

historical_42.txt$by this time the german supreme command had become more cheerful even optimistic as it saw that the piercing of the hindenburg line had not been followed by an actual allied breakthrough more encouragement came from reports of a slackening in the force of the allies attacks largely because they had advanced too far ahead of their supply lines ludendorff still wanted an armistice but only to give his troops a rest as a prelude to further resistance and to ensure a secure withdrawal to a shortened defensive line on the frontier by october 17 he even felt that his troops could do without a rest it was less that the situation had changed than that his impression of it had been revised it had never been quite so bad as he had pictured it on september 29 but his dismal first impression had now spread throughout german political circles and the public though they had endured increasing privations and were halfstarved due to the allied blockade by mid1918 the german people had retained their morale surprisingly well as long as they believed germany had a prospect of achieving victory on the western front when this hope collapsed in october 1918 many and perhaps even most germans wished only that the war would end though it might mean their nation would have to accept unfavourable peace terms german public opinion having been more suddenly disillusioned was now far more radically defeatist than the supreme command

historical_42.txt$a third german note to the united states sent on october 20 agreed to the unilateral settlement of conditions for the armistice and for the evacuation in the express belief that wilson would allow no affront to germanys honour the answering us note of october 23 conceded wilsons readiness to propose an armistice to the allies but added that the terms must be such as to make germany incapable of renewing hostilities ludendorff saw this militarily as a demand for unconditional surrender and would therefore have continued resistance but the situation had passed beyond his control and on october 26 he was made to resign by the emperor on prince maxs advice on october 27 germany acknowledged the us note

historical_42.txt$pleading the danger of bolshevism in a nation on the verge of collapse the german delegation obtained some mitigation of these terms a suggestion that the blockade might be relaxed a reduction in the quantity of armaments to be handed over and permission for the german forces in eastern europe to stay put for the time being the germans might have held out longer for further concessions if the fact of revolution on their home front had not been coupled with the imminence of a new blow from the west

historical_42.txt$though the allied advance was continuing and seemed in some sectors even to be accelerating the main german forces had managed to retreat ahead of it the germans destruction of roads and railways along the routes of their evacuation made it impossible for supplies to keep pace with the advancing allied troops a pause in the advance would occur while allied communications were being repaired and that would give the germans a breathing space in which to rally their resistance by november 11 the allied advance on the northern sectors of the front had come more or less to a standstill on a line running from pontàmousson through sedan mézières and mons to ghent foch however now had a francous force of 28 divisions and 600 tanks in the south ready to strike through metz into northeastern lorraine since fochs general offensive had absorbed the germans reserves this new offensive would fall on their bared left flank and held the promise of outflanking their whole new line of defense from antwerp to the line of the meuse and of intercepting any german retreat by this time the number of us divisions in france had risen to 42 in addition the british were about to bomb berlin on a scale hitherto unattempted in air warfare

historical_42.txt$the fact that matthias erzberger who was a civilian politician rather than a soldier headed the german armistice delegation became an integral part of the legend of the stab in the back dolchstoss im rücken this legends theme was that the german army was undefeated in the field unbesiegt im felde and had been stabbed in the backie had been denied support at the crucial moment by a weary and defeatist civilian population and their leaders this theme was adopted soon after the wars end by ludendorff himself and by other german generals who were unwilling to admit the hopelessness of germanys military situation in november 1918 and who wanted to vindicate the honour of german arms the stab in the back legend soon found its way into german historiography and was picked up by german rightwing political agitators who claimed that allied propaganda in germany in the last stages of the war had undermined civilian morale and that traitors among the politicians had been at hand ready to do the allies bidding by signing the armistice adolf hitler eventually became the foremost of these political agitators branding erzberger and the leaders of the social democrats as the november criminals and advocating militaristic and expansionist policies by which germany could redeem its defeat in the war gain vengeance upon its enemies and become the preeminent power in europe
