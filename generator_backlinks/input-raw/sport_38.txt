sport_38.txt$radcliffe proves doubters wrong
sport_38.txt$this wont go down as one of the greatest marathons of paulas career but as a test of character it was the toughest race shes ever taken part in
sport_38.txt$a win in the new york marathon doesnt make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year if paulas last experience of the year had been athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism she can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future even if shed lost this race there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it she knows she can dig deep if she needs to it was a strong field with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning and although two hours 23 minutes wasnt one of paulas best times it wasnt far off the record on a difficult course
sport_38.txt$i was speaking to paula in the leadup to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a nowin situation she thought that if she won people would say why couldnt she do that in athens and if she lost people would say her career was over and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and 10000m in athens but that was never on the cards she might have been beaten but she would have kept running the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens  the niggling injuries her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions  werent at play here the only question was what position she could finish in most important of all despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race there were never doubts in paulas mind if she wasnt confident she wouldnt have run after all if youre the best in the world at an event youll always have expectations of winning
sport_38.txt$now paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year have a wellearned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism
