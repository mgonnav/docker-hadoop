space_65.txt$this system would produce enough energy to drive the accelerator
space_65.txt$perhaps with some left over  a very high power 100s of mw cw or
space_65.txt$quasi cw very sharp proton beam would be required but this appears
space_65.txt$achievable using a linear accelerator  the biggest question mark
space_65.txt$would be the lead target chemistry and the online processing of all
space_65.txt$the elements being incinerated
space_65.txt$paul quite frankly ill believe that this is really going to work on
space_65.txt$the typical trash one needs to process when i see them put a couple
space_65.txt$tons in one end and get relatively clean material out the other end
space_65.txt$plus be able to run it off its own residual power  sounds almost like
space_65.txt$perpetual motion doesnt it
space_65.txt$fred the honest thing to do would be to admit your criticism on
space_65.txt$scientific grounds was invalid rather than pretend you were actually
space_65.txt$talking about engineering feasibility  given you postings i cant
space_65.txt$say i am surprised though
space_65.txt$well pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just
space_65.txt$tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying
space_65.txt$to recover the energy from this process which is at least trying to
space_65.txt$go the right way on the energy curve  now where did i put those
space_65.txt$sackcloth and ashes
space_65.txt$i was not and am not pretending anything i am so pleased you are
space_65.txt$not surprised though
space_65.txt$no it is nothing like perpetual motion
space_65.txt$note that i didnt say it was perpetual motion or even that it
space_65.txt$sounded like perpetual motion the phrase was sounds almost like
space_65.txt$perpetual motion which i at least consider a somewhat different
space_65.txt$propposition than the one you elect to criticize  perhaps i should
space_65.txt$beg your pardon for being too precise in my use of language
space_65.txt$the physics is well
space_65.txt$understood the energy comes from fission of actinides in subcritical
space_65.txt$assemblies  folks have talked about spallation reactors since the
space_65.txt$1950s  pulsed spallation neutron sources are in use today as research
space_65.txt$tools  accelerator design has been improving particularly with
space_65.txt$superconducting accelerating cavities which helps feasibility  los
space_65.txt$alamos has expertise in high current accelerators lampf so i
space_65.txt$believe they know what they are talking about
space_65.txt$i will believe that this process comes even close to approaching
space_65.txt$technological and economic feasibility given the mixed nature of the
space_65.txt$trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of
space_65.txt$separating things first and having a different run for each
space_65.txt$actinide when i see them dump a few tons in one end and pull
space_65.txt$relatively clean material out the other  once the costs
space_65.txt$technological risks etc are taken into account i still class this
space_65.txt$one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun  sure its possible
space_65.txt$and the physics are well understood but is it really a reasonable
space_65.txt$approach
space_65.txt$and i still wonder at what sort of burning rate you could get with
space_65.txt$something like this as opposed to what kind of energy you would
space_65.txt$really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power
space_65.txt$with and without the energy recovery  are we talking ounces pounds
space_65.txt$or tons grams kilograms or metric tons for you si fans of
space_65.txt$material and are we talking days weeks months or years days
space_65.txt$weeks months or years for you si fans  hmmm still using a
space_65.txt$nondecimated time scale i see  
space_65.txt$the real reason why accelerator breeders or incinerators are not being
space_65.txt$built is that there isnt any reason to do so  natural uranium is
space_65.txt$still too cheap and geological disposal of actinides looks
space_65.txt$technically reasonable
space_65.txt$insisting on perfect safety is for people who dont have the balls to live
space_65.txt$in the real world    mary shafer nasa ames dryden
