food_90.txt$saturated fats are found in few vegetable oils palm oil and palm kernel oil are two youll see listed in packaged foods but they are found in many spreads and condiments including butter lard cream cheese shortening and cream or cheesebased salad dressings as well as the skin on poultry and in certain cuts of meat while saturated fats have been thought in the past to contribute to heart disease as well as inflammation that can make other conditions worse recent information has made this issue less clear cut so although the jury is still out on whether saturated fats are really as bad as they were previously made out to be its important to not go butter crazy and still practice moderation until more research is done

food_90.txt$trans fats are far and away the worst type of fat although meats and dairy products contain trace amounts of naturallyoccurring trans fat the large majority of trans fats in the us diet are manmade these manmade trans fats are produced by adding hydrogen to vegetable oils and used in some baked goods and deepfryer oils to extend shelf life trans fats raise your bad ldl cholesterol and lower your good hdl cholesterol so they increase your risk of heart disease even more than saturated fats they also raise your risk of type 2 diabetes and increase inflammation which can worsen arthritis pain stick margarine typically contains trans fats and should therefore be avoided however many brands of soft tub margarine are now transfat free to identify healthy spreads make sure the label specifies 0 g trans fat and the ingredients panel does not list any hydrogenated oils

food_90.txt$other spreads include sterol and stanol spreads sterols and stanols are natural substances found in small amounts in the cell membranes of certain plants sterols and stanols have a structure similar to cholesterol these compounds compete with cholesterol for access to receptors in the digestive tract effectively blocking the absorption of dietary cholesterol and ultimately leading to lower blood cholesterol levels because you cant get therapeutic doses from food alone manufacturers have added concentrated amounts of sterols and stanols to certain hearthealthy spreads that taste and cook just like margarine these spreads should be used only by people with cholesterol problems who should consume no more than the recommended amount two to three tablespoons per day i suggest trying the light versions of these spreads to save calories
