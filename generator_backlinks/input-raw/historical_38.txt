historical_38.txt$repeated french attacks in februarymarch 1915 on the germans trench barrier in champagne won only 500 yards 460 metres of ground at a cost of 50000 men for the british sir douglas haigs 1st army between armentières and lens tried a new experiment at neuvechapelle on march 10 when its artillery opened an intense bombardment on a 2000yard front and then after 35 minutes lengthened its range so that the attacking british infantry behind the second screen of shells could overrun the trenches ravaged by the first but the experiments immediate result was merely loss of life both because shortage of munitions made the second barrage inadequate and because there was a fivehour delay in launching the infantry assault against which the germans having overcome their initial surprise had time to rally their resistance it was clear to the allies that this smallscale tactical experiment had missed success only by a narrow margin and that there was scope for its development but the allied commands missed the true lesson which was that a surprise attack could be successfully made immediately following a short bombardment that compensated for its brevity by its intensity instead they drew the superficial deduction that mere volume of shellfire was the key to reducing a trench line prior to an assault not until 1917 did they revert to the neuvechapelle method it was left to the germans to profit from the experiment in the meantime a french offensive in april against the germans saintmihiel salient southeast of verdun sacrificed 64000 men to no effect

historical_38.txt$the germans in accordance with falkenhayns strategy remained generally on the defensive in the west they did however launch an attack on the allies ypres salient where the french had in november 1914 taken the place of the british there on april 22 1915 they used chlorine gas for the first time on the western front but they made the mistake of discharging it from cylinders which were dependent on a favourable wind rather than lobbing it onto the enemy trenches in artillery shells the gas did throw the agonized defenders into chaotic flight but the german high command having been disappointed by the new weapons performance under adverse conditions in poland earlier in the year had failed to provide adequate reserves to exploit its unforeseen success by the end of a monthlong battle the allies front was only slightly retracted

historical_38.txt$on may 9 meanwhile the allies had launched yet another premature offensive combining a major french onslaught between lens and arras with two thrusts by haigs 1st army from festubert and from fromelles against the aubers ridge north of lens the french prolonged their effort until june 18 losing 102000 men without securing any gain the british still short of shells against the germans mass of machine guns had suspended their attacks three weeks earlier

historical_38.txt$an even worse military failure was the joint offensive launched by the allies on sept 25 1915 while 27 french divisions with 850 heavy guns attacked on a front 18 miles long in champagne north and east of reims simultaneous blows were delivered in distant artois by 14 french divisions with 420 heavy guns on a 12mile front south of lens and by six british divisions with only 117 guns at loos north of lens all of these attacks were disappointing failures partly because they were preceded by prolonged bombardments that gave away any chance of surprise and allowed time for german reserves to be sent forward to close up the gaps that had been opened in the trench defenders ranks by the artillery bombardment at loos the british use of chlorine gas was less effective than haig had hoped and his engagement of all his own available forces for his first assault came to nothing when his commander in chief sir john french was too slow in sending up reserves the french on both their fronts likewise lost through lack of timely support most of what they had won by their first attacks in all for a little ground the allies paid 242000 men against the defenders loss of 141000

historical_38.txt$the russians plans for 1915 prescribed the strengthening of their flanks in the north and in galicia before driving westward again toward silesia their preparations for a blow at east prussias southern frontier were forestalled as ludendorff striking suddenly eastward from east prussia enveloped four russian divisions in the augustów forests east of the masurian lakes in the second week of february but in galicia the winters fighting culminated on march 22 in the fall of przemyśl to the russians
historical_38.txt$for the central powers the austrian spokesman conrad primarily required some action to relieve the pressure on his galician front and falkenhayn was willing to help him for that purpose without departing from his own general strategy of attritionwhich was already coming into conflict with ludendorffs desire for a sustained effort toward decisive victory over russia the plan finally adopted with the aim of smashing the russian centre in the dunajec river sector of galicia by an attack on the 18mile front from gorlice to tuchów south of tarnów was conceived with tactical originality in order to maintain the momentum of advance no daily objectives were to be set for individual corps or divisions instead each should make all possible progress before the russians could bring their reserves up on the assumption that the rapid advance of some attacking units would contagiously promote the subsequent advance of others that had at first met more resistance late in april 14 divisions with 1500 guns were quietly concentrated for the stroke against the six russian divisions present mackensen was in command with hans von seeckt sponsor of the new tactic of infiltration as his chief of staff

historical_38.txt$the gorlice attack was launched on may 2 and achieved success beyond all expectation routed on the dunajec the russians tried to stand on the wisłoka then fell back again by may 14 mackensens forces were on the san 80 miles from their starting point and at jarosław they even forced a crossing of that river strengthened with more german troops from france mackensen then struck again taking przemyśl on june 3 and lemberg lvov on june 22 the russian front was now bisected but falkenhayn and conrad had foreseen no such result and had made no preparations to exploit it promptly their consequent delays enabled the russian armies to retreat without breaking up entirely

historical_38.txt$falkenhayn then decided to pursue a new offensive mackensen was instructed to veer northward so as to catch the russian armies in the warsaw salient between his forces and hindenburgs which were to drive southeastward from east prussia ludendorff disliked the plan as being too much of a frontal assault the russians might be squeezed by the closingin of the two wings but their retreat to the east would not be cut off he once more urged his spring scheme for a wide enveloping maneuver through kovno kaunas on vilna vilnius and minsk in the north falkenhayn opposed this plan fearing that it would mean more troops and a deeper commitment and on july 2 the german emperor decided in favour of falkenhayns plan

historical_38.txt$the results justified ludendorffs reservations the russians held mackensen at brestlitovsk and hindenburg on the narew river long enough to enable the main body of their troops to escape through the unclosed gap to the east though by the end of august all of poland had been occupied and 750000 russians had been taken prisoner in four months of fighting the central powers had missed their opportunity to break russias ability to carry on the war

historical_38.txt$too late falkenhayn in september allowed ludendorff to try what he had been urging much earlier a wider enveloping movement to the north on the kovnodvinskvilna triangle the german cavalry in fact approached the minsk railway far beyond vilna but the russians power of resistance was too great for ludendorffs slender forces whose supplies moreover began to run out and by the end of the month his operations were suspended the crux of this situation was that the russian armies had been allowed to draw back almost out of the net before the longdelayed vilna maneuver was attempted meanwhile an austrian attack eastward from lutsk luck begun later in september and continued into october incurred heavy losses for no advantage at all by october 1915 the russian retreat after a nervewracking series of escapes from the salients the germans had systematically created and then sought to cut off had come to a definite halt along a line running from the baltic sea just west of riga southward to czernowitz chernovtsy on the romanian border
