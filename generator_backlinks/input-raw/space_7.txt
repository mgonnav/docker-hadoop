space_7.txt$ double wow  can you land a shuttle with a 5cm hole in the wall
space_7.txt$personnally i dont know but id like to try it sometime
space_7.txt$programmatically yes we can land an orbiter with a 5 cm hole in
space_7.txt$the wall  provided that the thing which caused 5 cm hole didnt
space_7.txt$cause a crit 1 failure on some of the internal systems  there are
space_7.txt$a few places where a 5 cm hole would cause a bad day  especially
space_7.txt$if the 5 cm hole went all the way through the orbiter and out the
space_7.txt$other side as could easily happen with a meteor strike  but a
space_7.txt$hole in the pressure vessel would cause us to immediately deorbit
space_7.txt$to the next available landing site
