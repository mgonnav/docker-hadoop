graphics_74.txt$use these so cant say much about them you only buy the packages your
graphics_74.txt$particular applicationinterest calls for
graphics_74.txt$each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from
graphics_74.txt$a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default
graphics_74.txt$directory  some utilities will share parameters and use the same
graphics_74.txt$parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting
graphics_74.txt$up a series of operations  the standard pci environment contains a
graphics_74.txt$scripting language very similar to ibmpc basic but which allows you to
graphics_74.txt$automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated
graphics_74.txt$lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  in vms i can also
graphics_74.txt$invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure  theres
graphics_74.txt$also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled

graphics_74.txt$the pci software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but
graphics_74.txt$requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the
graphics_74.txt$level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle
graphics_74.txt$a few other things as well  for instance the tape io package offers a
graphics_74.txt$utility for reading headerless multiband what adobe photoshop on the
graphics_74.txt$macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different
graphics_74.txt$interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
graphics_74.txt$graphicarts industrys ct2t format would probably i havent tried
graphics_74.txt$handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what
graphics_74.txt$youre doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start
graphics_74.txt$over  its worth noting that the pci database file is designed to
graphics_74.txt$contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map
graphics_74.txt$information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of
graphics_74.txt$other information i observe that a remotesensing image tape often
graphics_74.txt$contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude
graphics_74.txt$longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this
graphics_74.txt$can go into the pci database
graphics_74.txt$i believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  on vax
graphics_74.txt$systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific
graphics_74.txt$thirdparty display systems the name goulddeanza seems to come to

graphics_74.txt$display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vctq qbus
graphics_74.txt$24bit directcolor display subsystem  pci software could be overkill
graphics_74.txt$in your case it seems designed for the very high end
graphics_74.txt$applicationsusers ie those for whom a macpc largely doesnt suffice
graphics_74.txt$although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  its
graphics_74.txt$probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which
