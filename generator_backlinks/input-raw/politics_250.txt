politics_250.txt$weve called for the state pension to be increased from 7960 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of 10545 thats what were calling for many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system if weve got one in five pensioners below the poverty line weve got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty
politics_250.txt$weve drawn up a pensioners manifesto this will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies they will be asked which of the top five issues including the pension issue they would support once weve got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well its our way of putting the politicians on notice we are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters before 1997 most pensioners voted conservative in 1997 and 2001 they voted labour but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around they cannot take that vote for granted

politics_250.txt$that the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment
politics_250.txt$we havent worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing we dont have any large demonstrations planned but they cant be ruled out
politics_250.txt$it is hard to say whether we will be successful we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq

politics_250.txt$we are challenging the use of the parliament act 1949 in a high court action we are hoping to hear in the new year whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time when the ban comes into force on 18 february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid so theres a lot of legal territory to go we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is rural affairs minister alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult it is not intimidatory  on the whole it is groups of angry housewives of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything

politics_250.txt$the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade its become an issue in itself but whats really missing from the debate is the consumers choice in that choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools we have seen so many pensions misselling scandals and in the pensions industry theres a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that we want choice on the consumers terms  that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice
