graphics_6.txt$see some small machbanding on the smooth colorgradient picture but all in all
graphics_6.txt$there are situiations where you get visible machbanding even in
graphics_6.txt$a 24 bit card if
graphics_6.txt$you create a very smooth color gradient of darkgreenwhiteyellow
graphics_6.txt$or something and turn
graphics_6.txt$up the contrast on the monitor you will probably see some machbanding
graphics_6.txt$while i dont mean to damn henriks attempt to be helpful here
graphics_6.txt$hes using a common misconception that should be corrected
graphics_6.txt$mach banding will occur for any image  it is not the color
graphics_6.txt$quantization you see when you dont have enough bits  it is the

graphics_6.txt$the result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on
