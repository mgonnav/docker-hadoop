graphics_37.txt$how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a
graphics_37.txt$set of points edges and faces
graphics_37.txt$look for edge inconsistencies  consider two vertices p and q which
graphics_37.txt$are connected by at least one edge
graphics_37.txt$if pq is an edge then qp should not appear
graphics_37.txt$if both pq and qp appear as edges then the surface flips when
graphics_37.txt$you travel across that edge  this is bad
graphics_37.txt$assuming warningwarningwarning that you have an otherwise
graphics_37.txt$acceptable surface  you can pick an edge any edge and traverse the
graphics_37.txt$surface enforcing consistency with that edge
graphics_37.txt$0 pick an edge pq and mark it as ok
graphics_37.txt$1 for each face f containing this edge if more than 2 oops
graphics_37.txt$make sure that all edges in f are consistent ie the face
graphics_37.txt$should be pqqrrssttp  flip those which
graphics_37.txt$are wrong mark all of the edges in f as ok
graphics_37.txt$and add them to a queue check for duplicates and especially
graphics_37.txt$inconsistencies  dont let the queue have both pq and qp
graphics_37.txt$2 remove an edge from the queue and go to 1
graphics_37.txt$if a marked edge is discovered to be inconsistent then you lose
graphics_37.txt$if step 1 finds more than one face sharing a particular edge then you
graphics_37.txt$lose
graphics_37.txt$otherwise when done all of the edges will be consistent  which means
graphics_37.txt$that all of the surface normals will either point in or out  deciding
graphics_37.txt$which way is out is left as an exercise
