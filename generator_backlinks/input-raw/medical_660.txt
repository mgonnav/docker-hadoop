medical_660.txt$this is to followup my previous reply on this topic which it has been
medical_660.txt$pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots
medical_660.txt$1  i stated that psychotherapy meaning talking therapy and so on was used
medical_660.txt$to treat obsessive compulsive disorder which though sometimes true is
medical_660.txt$misleading  it is not often found effective particularly by itself
medical_660.txt$primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug
medical_660.txt$therapy  the most current theories of this condition attribute
medical_660.txt$it to more to biological causes than psychological in places where this
medical_660.txt$distinction becomes important
medical_660.txt$2  i mentioned that the dsmiiir mentions impulses as a possible
medical_660.txt$diagnostic marker  however this might look like something
medical_660.txt$people associate with psychotic conditions uncontrollable or
medical_660.txt$unpredictable behaviors which is not the case with ocd
medical_660.txt$one of the diagnostic criteria of ocd is that the individual
medical_660.txt$can and does suppress some of their impulses although they
medical_660.txt$are an unending source of anxiety
medical_660.txt$the obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with
medical_660.txt$ocd are most frequently very mundane and predictable closer to
medical_660.txt$a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part
medical_660.txt$some references one nontechnical and several technical
