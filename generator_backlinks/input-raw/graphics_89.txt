graphics_89.txt$ i am looking for an algorithm to determine if a given point is bound by a
graphics_89.txt$ polygon does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing
graphics_89.txt$ information on the subject

graphics_89.txt$basically there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside
graphics_89.txt$outside or on the polygon the first one is ray or half line method in
graphics_89.txt$this method you can draw any ray if the number of the intersection point
graphics_89.txt$of the ray and the polygon is even then it is outside if the number is odd
graphics_89.txt$then it is inside of cause you have to deal with the special cases which
graphics_89.txt$may make you headache
graphics_89.txt$the second method is pi algorithm draw the lines between the point and
graphics_89.txt$all the vertices on the polygon calculate and sum the angles of the
graphics_89.txt$successive lines if the result is 2pi then it is inside if pi then
graphics_89.txt$it is on the polygon otherwise it is outside
graphics_89.txt$my experience tells the second method is relible
graphics_89.txt$hope this helps
