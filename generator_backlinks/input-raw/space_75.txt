space_75.txt$ i had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in
space_75.txt$ first and second grade 6970 7071  they came in chocolate
space_75.txt$ strawberry and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long
space_75.txt$ and 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil well it seemed
space_75.txt$ like space foil at the time
space_75.txt$wasnt there a plain flavor too  they looked more like some
space_75.txt$kind of extruded industrial product than food  perfectly
space_75.txt$smooth cylinders with perfectly smooth ends  kinda scary
space_75.txt$ the taste is hard to describe although i remember it fondly  it was
space_75.txt$ most certainly more candy than say a modern power bar  sort of
space_75.txt$ a toffee injected with vitamins  the chocolate power bar is a rough
space_75.txt$ approximation of the taste  strawberry sucked
space_75.txt$an other post described it as like a microwaved tootsie roll 
space_75.txt$which captures the texture pretty well  as for taste they were
space_75.txt$like candy only not very sweet  does that make sense i recall
space_75.txt$liking them for their texture not taste i guess i have well
space_75.txt$developed texture buds
space_75.txt$ man these were my 60s
space_75.txt$it was obligatory to eat a few while watching captain scarlet
space_75.txt$does anybody else remember that as long as were off the
space_75.txt$topic of space
