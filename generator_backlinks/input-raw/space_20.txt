space_20.txt$i thought the area rule was pioneered by boeing
space_20.txt$nasa guys developed the rule  but noone knew if it worked
space_20.txt$until boeing built the hardware 727 and maybe the fb111
space_20.txt$nope  the decisive triumph of the area rule was when convairs yf102 
space_20.txt$contractually commmitted to being a mach 15 fighter and actually found
space_20.txt$to be incapable of going supersonic in level flight  was turned into
space_20.txt$the arearuled yf102a which met the specs  this was well before either
space_20.txt$the 727 or the fb111 the 102 flew in late 1953 and convair spent most
space_20.txt$of the first half of 1954 figuring out what went wrong and most of the
space_20.txt$second half building the first 102a

space_20.txt$good thing i stuck in a couple of question marks up there
space_20.txt$i seem to recall somebody built  or at least proposed a wasp waisetd
space_20.txt$passenger civil transport  i thought it was a 727  but maybe it
space_20.txt$was a dc 89   sure it had a funny passenger compartment
space_20.txt$but on the other hand  it seemed to save fuel
space_20.txt$i thought area rules  applied even before transonic speeds  just
space_20.txt$not as badly
space_20.txt$pat
